00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,510
Hi.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,530
I'm Ricardo.

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,350
I work on the Google Play team.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,630
I'm going to tell you about all the tools

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,340
available in the Developer Console

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,480
to help you build high quality apps for Google Play,

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,620
from tips in the publishing process,

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,210
to how to make the best of the data reporting available to you.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's start from the basics-- targeting the right audience.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,190
First, it's a good idea to do a bit of market research

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,070
and assess your target audience.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,950
Understand and what and what versions and screen sizes

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,040
you want to target.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,000
If you go to developer.android.com

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,850
and search for dashboards, you can get relevant graphs

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,970
to show you which versions you would want to support.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,000
You're likely to get the best result, if you design your app

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
to work on tablets from the start.

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
The increased screen area on tablets

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,920
gives you more possibilities and allows

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,290
for more engagement with the user, which

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,130
can mean increased usage as well as more monetization opportunities.

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,880
If you're building a game, make sure you

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,730
choose the right category among the 18 new game

25
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,349
categories recently added in Google Play.

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,540
After sorting out the general outline and placement

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,010
of your app, it's time to start building it.

28
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,150
But don't wait until your app is 100%

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,900
finished before showing it to people.

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,000
We have designed beta testing to help

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,020
you get user feedback as early as possible.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,470
Before your app is ready to be seen by the world,

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,390
you can distribute it to a group of users you select.

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,689
We call this alpha and beta test groups.

35
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,980
If you don't yet have a production version of your app,

36
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,540
your app will be invisible in Google Play,

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,990
except to the testers you choose.

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,750
If you're using Google Play Games Services,

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,090
you can use the alpha and beta testing

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,590
to test your game services as well.

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,540
You can use Google groups or Google+ communities to indicate

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,300
which users you want to be able to access the test versions

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,630
of your apps.

44
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,790
You can set a what's new field for each version of your app,

45
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,620
including the ones for testers.

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,450
And this is really useful to tell your testers what's

47
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,350
new in the alpha and beta versions they are about to receive.

48
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,470
Each user will need to opt in to be a tester for each app

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,730
and unload the app of course.

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,490
To aid users in doing so, many developers create a little web

51
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,890
page with a set of instructions that they send out

52
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,290
to their testers, or mention it in their group or Google+ community.

53
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,080
Now that your alpha and beta test is in progress.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,310
It's good to know that users who are alpha or beta testers

55
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,370
cannot leave reviews for your app.

56
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,020
In this way, you can protect against leaks

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,680
about your secret app or harm to your ratings

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,660
if you're beta version still has some bugs.

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,670
However, you can still see crash reports, optimization tapes,

60
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,220
and statistics in the Developer Console.

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,330
And we explicitly mark out results

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,160
that pertain to your alpha or beta test.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,530
So for example, you can quickly isolate all application crashes

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,660
that your beta testers are experiencing.

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,900
Your beta testers are great for identifying

66
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,210
bugs and the usability problems.

67
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,850
But keep in mind, they are not a representative sample

68
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,390
of your target user population.

69
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
Once your app is looking good to your beta testers,

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,560
and it has been through a full round of testing on your side,

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,404
it's time to publish.

72
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,070
Once your app is published to all users,

73
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,430
you will have some options when you roll out your next updates.

74
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,564
Here at Google.

75
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,730
We want to be sure that everything goes well when we

76
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,385
roll out new version of our apps.

77
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:20,540
And we know that you do as well.

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,440
For this, we design staged rollouts.

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,180
You can rollout updates of your app

80
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,120
to just a percentage of your users, like 5%,

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,430
and then crank it up to 100% when

82
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,310
you can see that the reviews are still good,

83
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,830
and there are no problems on the horizon.

84
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,070
Don't panic, if you realize that you rolled out a bad version

85
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,340
while a staged rollout is still in progress.

86
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,860
Spin up a bug fix and publish a new version.

87
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,219
Your fix will go out to the users who have the bad one,

88
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,510
and you can resume the rollout.

89
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,710
Now that I covered the publishing process, let's focus

90
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,140
on monitoring how your app is doing.

91
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,740
Here at Google we think that the developers do best

92
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,940
when they have lots of insights into their users and app performance.

93
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,640
Most successful developers tell us

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,570
that they log into the Developer Console

95
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,740
every day to check on their statistics, reviews,

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,880
and optimization tips.

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,560
Here's an overview of some of the types of data

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,440
that is offered in the Developer Console

99
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,560
that we think more developers should be looking at.

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,610
Starting from the basics, most of you

101
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,950
know that you can see installs and the uninstalls

102
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,930
over time in the Developer Console.

103
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,460
In addition to that, if you just go to the statistics page,

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,440
you can see how your app ratings have changed over time, crash

105
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,010
trends and if you link your Developer Console

106
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,230
account with Google Analytics, data about your active users,

107
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,320
and their engagement with your app.

108
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
Be sure to click on app version to make

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,290
sure you compare your new versions against the older ones.

110
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,390
Also use the CSV exports to download the full data set

111
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,485
beyond the first top 10 values.

112
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,610
If you're a game developer and you use Google Play Games

113
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,590
Services in your app, you can monitor your game performance

114
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,610
and key player metrics using the new game stats module

115
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,560
that we just launched a few weeks ago.

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,390
Crashes can be a major problem.

117
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,980
They make users unhappy and dissatisfied.

118
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,990
They can result in bad reviews and users

119
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,210
uninstalling your app in frustration.

120
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,915
So we have spent time making the crash reporting feature

121
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:17,520
in the Developer Console even better.

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,310
You can check on your beta test and your stage rollout

123
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,390
by filtering your crashes by version.

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,590
You can also see how these crashes break

125
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,880
down across different devices and Android versions

126
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,610
to make it easier to track down what's going wrong

127
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,130
or why users on a certain device are complaining.

128
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,220
If you develop a native code, we have improved the reporting

129
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,280
and presentation, specifically for native crashes,

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,380
with better clustering of similar crashes

131
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,190
and summarizing of relevant information.

132
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,500
Also, remember that we collect crashes in real time,

133
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,660
so you can monitor your staged rollout or beta version

134
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,860
minutes after publishing it.

135
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,810
Finally, optimization tapes show you new ways

136
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,810
that you can improve, tailored to your own apps and users.

137
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,080
From adding translations, making sure your app works well

138
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,980
on tablets and ensuring your app is using the latest

139
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,480
versions of the Google services you integrate with.

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,090
We also help you out with alerts,

141
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,300
letting you know if there's been a big change in your installs,

142
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,510
uninstalls, ratings, or crashes.

143
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,130
With alerts, you can trust Google to alert you

144
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,210
whenever a relevant event occurs.

145
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,190
So you can focus on building your app.

146
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,670
We just added the ability to get these alerts over e-mail.

147
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,150
So make sure you subscribe to this new service

148
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,210
from the setting section of the Developer Console.

149
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,430
To summarize, let me remind you the core aspects in building

150
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,370
a quality app-- research and identify your target audience,

151
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,690
collect early feedback by your beta testers

152
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,980
while development is still in progress,

153
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,720
do risk-free releases with stage rollouts,

154
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,710
and keep optimizing your app with the data

155
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,680
that Google Play makes available to you.

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,750
Now get cracking.
