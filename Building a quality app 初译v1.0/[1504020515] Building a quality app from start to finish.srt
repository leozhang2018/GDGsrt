1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,510
Hi 
Hi.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,530
我是Ricardo
I'm Ricardo.

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,350
我来自Google Play团队
I work on the Google Play team.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,630
我将要和你分享Developer Console中
I'm going to tell you about all the tools

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,340
一些可获取的工具
available in the Developer Console

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,480
以帮助你在Google Play上创造出高质量的应用
to help you build high quality apps for Google Play,

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,620
从应用发布过程中的小建议
from tips in the publishing process,

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,210
再到如何去做适合你自己的数据报告
to how to make the best of the data reporting available to you.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,000
让我们从最基本的开始  正确的定位受众
Let's start from the basics-- targeting the right audience.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,190
首先  前期的一些市场调查和目标群体评估
First, it's a good idea to do a bit of market research

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,070
是一个好主意
and assess your target audience.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,950
了解你将要定位的
Understand and what and what versions and screen sizes

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,040
受众的系统版本以及屏幕尺寸
you want to target.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,000
如果你访问developer.android.com
If you go to developer.android.com

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,850
找到Dashboard一栏  你会看到相关的数据图表
and search for dashboards, you can get relevant graphs

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,970
向你展示了你该支持哪个版本
to show you which versions you would want to support.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,000
那里你也能得到更好的答案  如果你开始想设计一款
You're likely to get the best result, if you design your app

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
可以在平板上运行的应用的话
to work on tablets from the start.

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
平板上不断攀升的屏幕面积
The increased screen area on tablets

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,920
给了你无限的可能
gives you more possibilities and allows

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,290
并且让应用和用户有着更多的互动
for more engagement with the user, which

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,130
意味着会有不断增加的使用率以及更多盈利的机会
can mean increased usage as well as more monetization opportunities.

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,880
如果你想开发一款游戏应用的话
If you're building a game, make sure you

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,730
请确保在最近添加到Google Play中的18种游戏分类的里面
choose the right category among the 18 new game

25
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,349
选择正确的分类
categories recently added in Google Play.

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,540
在理顺完应用的要点以及定位之后
After sorting out the general outline and placement

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,010
是时候开始动手开发它
of your app, it's time to start building it.

28
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,150
但是无须等到应用开发进度完成100%时
But don't wait until your app is 100%

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,900
才推送给用户
finished before showing it to people.

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,000
我们为开发者提供了Beta版测试
We have designed beta testing to help

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,020
以帮助开发者能够尽快的得到用户反馈
you get user feedback as early as possible.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,470
在应用尚未正式面世之前
Before your app is ready to be seen by the world,

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,390
你可以先将应用推送至你安排好的用户测试组
you can distribute it to a group of users you select.

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,689
我们称之为Alpha和Beta版测试组
We call this alpha and beta test groups.

35
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,980
若你的应用尚未发布正式版本
If you don't yet have a production version of your app,

36
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,540
除了那些已经在测试组里面的用户
your app will be invisible in Google Play,

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,990
你的应用在Google Play上是不可见的
except to the testers you choose.

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,750
如果你正在使用Google Play游戏服务
If you're using Google Play Games Services,

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,090
你也可以通过Alpha和Beta版测试
you can use the alpha and beta testing

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,590
来测试你的游戏服务
to test your game services as well.

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,540
你可以利用Google网上论坛或者是Google+社群
You can use Google groups or Google+ communities to indicate

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,300
将你希望加入Alpha和Beta版测试组的人员添加到其中
which users you want to be able to access the test versions

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,630
of your apps.

44
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,790
你可以为每个应用版本以及测试人员
You can set a what's new field for each version of your app,

45
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,620
都设定不同的组别
including the ones for testers.

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,450
而这就能有效的告诉你的测试人员
And this is really useful to tell your testers what's

47
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,350
他(她)们将要收到的Alpha或者是Beta版应用都有哪些新特性
new in the alpha and beta versions they are about to receive.

48
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,470
每位用户都有选择成为每个应用的测试人员
Each user will need to opt in to be a tester for each app

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,730
卸载也同样如此
and unload the app of course.

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,490
为了帮助用户成为测试人员  大多数开发者一般会提供一些网页 
To aid users in doing so, many developers create a little web

51
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,890
上面有一系列提供给测试者的相关指导说明
page with a set of instructions that they send out

52
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,290
或者是在Google+测试组的社群进行相关提及
to their testers, or mention it in their group or Google+ community.

53
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,080
在进行Alpha和Beta版测试过程中
Now that your alpha and beta test is in progress.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,310
Alpha或者是Beta版的测试人员
It's good to know that users who are alpha or beta testers

55
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,370
是无法对你的应用进行相关评价的
cannot leave reviews for your app.

56
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,020
通过这种方式  可以有效的保护你的新版应用
In this way, you can protect against leaks

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,680
防止信息泄露和被恶意刷评
about your secret app or harm to your ratings

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,660
如果你的Beta版本仍有一些bug存在的话
if you're beta version still has some bugs.

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,670
你仍旧可以在Developer Console中查看相关数据统计
However, you can still see crash reports, optimization tips,

60
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,220
以及应用优化建议和崩溃报告
and statistics in the Developer Console.

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,330
它把隶属于不同Alpha和Beta版测试组的结果
And we explicitly mark out results

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,160
明确的标记出来
that pertain to your alpha or beta test.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,530
举个例子  你可以快速地把所有Beta版测试人员
So for example, you can quickly isolate all application crashes

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,660
在测试过程中的应用崩溃报告分离开来
that your beta testers are experiencing.

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,900
你的Beta版测试人员更有助于
Your beta testers are great for identifying

66
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,210
帮你发现bug和易用性问题
bugs and the usability problems.

67
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,850
但是请务必注意  他(她)们并不能代表
But keep in mind, they are not a representative sample

68
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,390
所有的应用受众用户
of your target user population.

69
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
一旦你的应用经过了好几轮的测试
Once your app is looking good to your beta testers,

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,560
并且在Beta版测试用户的圈子里普遍反响不错
and it has been through a full round of testing on your side,

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,404
那就是时候正式发布了
it's time to publish.

72
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,070
在应用正式发布给所有用户以后
Once your app is published to all users,

73
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,430
当你推出你的下一个更新之时  你会有些选择的余地
you will have some options when you roll out your next updates.

74
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,564
在Google
Here at Google.

75
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,730
我们希望每次推出新版本应用的更新
We want to be sure that everything goes well when we

76
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,385
都能如愿以偿的正常运行
roll out new version of our apps.

77
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:20,540
我想你也是这样想的
And we know that you do as well.

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,440
为此  我们推出了分阶段发布的方式
For this, we design staged rollouts.

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,180
你可以向一定比例的用户提供应用更新
You can rollout updates of your app

80
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,120
比如说5%
to just a percentage of your users, like 5%,

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,430
然后随着时间的推移
and then crank it up to 100% when

82
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,310
你发现反馈一切良好  并且没出现什么问题
you can see that the reviews are still good,

83
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,830
可以将比例增大至100%
and there are no problems on the horizon.

84
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,070
不必惊慌失措  即使你意识到推出了糟糕的版本
Don't panic, if you realize that you rolled out a bad version

85
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,340
在分阶段发布模式仍旧运行的时候
while a staged rollout is still in progress.

86
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,860
修复问题之后  发布一个全新版本即可
Spin up a bug fix and publish a new version.

87
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,219
新的版本将会取缔用户之前安装的糟糕版本
Your fix will go out to the users who have the bad one,

88
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,510
然后你可以恢复分阶段发布
and you can resume the rollout.

89
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,710
至此  我们已经讨论完了应用的发布过程
Now that I covered the publishing process, let's focus

90
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,140
让我们开始专注于监视应用的动向
on monitoring how your app is doing.

91
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,740
我们认为开发者在洞察用户
Here at Google we think that the developers do best

92
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,940
以及专注于应用性能方面做的很棒
when they have lots of insights into their users and app performance.

93
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,640
大多数成功的开发者告诉我们说
Most successful developers tell us

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,570
他(她)们每天都登入Developer Console
that they log into the Developer Console

95
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,740
检视应用基本统计和各种反馈
every day to check on their statistics, reviews,

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,880
以及优化建议
and optimization tips.

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,560
这是由Developer Console提供的
Here's an overview of some of the types of data

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,440
一些数据类型的概览
that is offered in the Developer Console

99
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,560
我们希望更多的开发者都该看看它
that we think more developers should be looking at.

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,610
从最基本的开始
Starting from the basics, most of you

101
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,950
你可以在Developer Console看到
know that you can see installs and the uninstalls

102
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,930
指定日期范围内的安装以及卸载量
over time in the Developer Console.

103
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,460
除此之外  如果你到统计页面
In addition to that, if you just go to the statistics page,

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,440
你可以看到应用一定时间范围内的评分情况和崩溃趋势
you can see how your app ratings have changed over time, crash

105
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,010
前提是在你把Developer Console账户
trends and if you link your Developer Console

106
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,230
和Google Analytics帐户关联起来之后  活跃的用户数据
account with Google Analytics, data about your active users,

107
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,320
以及互动情况全都一目了然
and their engagement with your app.

108
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
别忘记点击App version
Be sure to click on app version to make

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,290
以确保能进行新的应用版本和旧版本的对比
sure you compare your new versions against the older ones.

110
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,390
也可以使用导出统计信息为CSV格式的方法
Also use the CSV exports to download the full data set

111
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,485
将更多的数据导出
beyond the first top 10 values.

112
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,610
如果你是一名游戏应用开发者并且使用Google Play游戏服务的话
If you're a game developer and you use Google Play Games

113
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,590
通过新游戏统计模块
Services in your app, you can monitor your game performance

114
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,610
你可以时刻监视着游戏的相关表现以及关键的玩家指标
and key player metrics using the new game stats module

115
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,560
这也是我们几周前上线的新功能
that we just launched a few weeks ago.

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,390
应用崩溃是一个重要问题
Crashes can be a major problem.

117
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,980
它们会令用户感到沮丧和不满
They make users unhappy and dissatisfied.

118
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,990
也可以导致应用收到一系列的差评
They can result in bad reviews and users

119
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,210
让用户在沮丧中卸载掉开发者的应用
uninstalling your app in frustration.

120
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,915
所以我们花了大量的时间让Developer Console中的
So we have spent time making the crash reporting feature

121
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:17,520
崩溃报告机制变得更加完善
in the Developer Console even better.

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,310
你可以查看Beta版测试组以及分阶段发布中的崩溃报告
You can check on your beta test and your stage rollout

123
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,390
通过筛选系统版本的方式
by filtering your crashes by version.

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,590
你也可以了解这些崩溃情况
You can also see how these crashes break

125
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,880
是怎样在不同的设备以及系统版本上发生的
down across different devices and Android versions

126
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,610
这使得错误追踪变的异常容易
to make it easier to track down what's going wrong

127
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,130
以及知晓为何用户在某个特定设备上总是怨气重重
or why users on a certain device are complaining.

128
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,220
如果你开发本地代码的话  我们为本地崩溃对应地完善了
If you develop a native code, we have improved the reporting

129
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,280
崩溃报告机制以及表现形式
and presentation, specifically for native crashes,

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,380
更好的将相关崩溃加以类聚
with better clustering of similar crashes

131
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,190
同时对相关信息进行总结
and summarizing of relevant information.

132
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,500
而且  崩溃的收集是实时的
Also, remember that we collect crashes in real time,

133
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,660
所以你可以立刻监视应用的阶段发布或者是Beta版本
so you can monitor your staged rollout or beta version

134
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,860
在你正式发布它之后
minutes after publishing it.

135
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,810
最后  相关的优化建议会向你展现
Finally, optimization tips show you new ways

136
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,810
应用可进行优化的新方法  为你的应用以及用户量身订做  
that you can improve, tailored to your own apps and users.

137
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,080
从添加翻译  到确保你的应用在平板上工作正常
From adding translations, making sure your app works well

138
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,980
再到确认你的应用所使用的是
on tablets and ensuring your app is using the latest

139
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,480
最新版本的Google services
versions of the Google services you integrate with.

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,090
我们也会通过提醒的方式帮助帮助你
We also help you out with alerts,

141
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,300
如果在应用安装卸载  评分以及崩溃方面有什么重大变故
letting you know if there's been a big change in your installs,

142
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,510
提醒机制会及时让你知道
uninstalls, ratings, or crashes.

143
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,130
通过提醒机制  坚信Google
With alerts, you can trust Google to alert you

144
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,210
会在相关事情发生后第一时间通知你
