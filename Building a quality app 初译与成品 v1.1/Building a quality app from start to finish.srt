1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,510
嗨
Hi.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,530
我是Ricardo
I'm Ricardo.

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,350
我来自Google Play团队
I work on the Google Play team.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,630
现在就让我来跟你讲几个
I'm going to tell you about all the tools

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,340
在开发者控制台里能够施展的招数吧
available in the Developer Console

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,480
让它们来帮你为Google Play创作出高质量的应用
to help you build high quality apps for Google Play,

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,620
我会从发布过程中的小提示讲起
from tips in the publishing process,

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,210
还会涵盖如何获得对自己有用的数据报表
to how to make the best of the data reporting available to you.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,000
让我们从最基本的开始  确立合适的目标用户
Let's start from the basics-- targeting the right audience.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,190
首先  做一些市场调查和目标用户评估
First, it's a good idea to do a bit of market research

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,070
还是很不错的
and assess your target audience.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,950
还要去了解哪些Android版本和屏幕尺寸
Understand and what and what versions and screen sizes

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,040
是你所要去适配的
you want to target.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,000
访问developer.android.com
If you go to developer.android.com

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,850
在Dashboard项里  可以得到一些相关的图表
and search for dashboards, you can get relevant graphs

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,970
它们会告诉你的应用都应该支持哪些版本
to show you which versions you would want to support.

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,000
如果一开始你就为各种移动设备的适配做足了准备
You're likely to get the best result, if you design your app

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
那么你离成功也就不远了
to work on tablets from the start.

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
屏幕尺寸的种类变多
The increased screen area on tablets

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,920
给了你更多的机会
gives you more possibilities and allows

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,290
这让你能够拉到更多不同需求的用户
for more engagement with the user, which

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,130
从而就会有不断增长的使用量  并会赚到更多的钱
can mean increased usage as well as more monetization opportunities.

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,880
如果你想开发一款游戏的话
If you're building a game, make sure you

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,730
请在Google Play列出的最新的18种分类里
choose the right category among the 18 new game

25
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,349
为你的游戏选择一个合适的分类
categories recently added in Google Play.

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,540
在理顺完开发要点  确定产品定位后
After sorting out the general outline and placement

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,010
就可以动手开发了
of your app, it's time to start building it.

28
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,150
但是不要等到100%都做完时
But don't wait until your app is 100%

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,900
才向用户推出你的应用
finished before showing it to people.

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,000
我们为开发者提供了测试工具
We have designed beta testing to help

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,020
以帮助开发者能够尽早的得到用户反馈
you get user feedback as early as possible.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,470
在应用尚未正式面世之前
Before your app is ready to be seen by the world,

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,390
你可以先将应用推送至你安排好的用户测试组
you can distribute it to a group of users you select.

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,689
我们称之为Alpha/Beta版测试组
We call this alpha and beta test groups.

35
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,980
若你的应用尚未发布正式版本
If you don't yet have a production version of your app,

36
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,540
除了那些已经在测试组里面的用户
your app will be invisible in Google Play,

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,990
你的应用在Google Play上对其他人是不可见的
except to the testers you choose.

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,750
如果你正在使用Google Play游戏服务
If you're using Google Play Games Services,

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,090
你也可以通过Alpha/Beta版测试工具
you can use the alpha and beta testing

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,590
来测试你的游戏服务
to test your game services as well.

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,540
你可以利用Google网上论坛或者G+社群
You can use Google groups or Google+ communities to indicate

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,300
安排测试人员对你的应用
which users you want to be able to access the test versions

43
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,630
进行测试
of your apps.

44
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,790
你可以对应用的每个版本都设置发布范围
You can set a what's new field for each version of your app,

45
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,620
也可以对测试组进行归类
including the ones for testers.

46
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,450
这样一来  很容易就能通知到各测试组的人员
And this is really useful to tell your testers what's

47
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,350
刚才给他们发布的Alpha/Beta版应用都有哪些新特征
new in the alpha and beta versions they are about to receive.

48
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,470
每位用户都有权成为应用的测试人员
Each user will need to opt in to be a tester for each app

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,730
同样有权卸载应用
and unload the app of course.

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,490
为了帮助用户成为测试人员  开发人员会建立一个简单的网页
To aid users in doing so, many developers create a little web

51
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,890
把为测试人员准备的教程挂到上面
page with a set of instructions that they send out

52
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,290
或者把教程挂到Google网上论坛  G+社群上
to their testers, or mention it in their group or Google+ community.

53
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,080
在进行Alpha/Beta版测试的过程中
Now that your alpha and beta test is in progress.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,310
告诉你一个好消息  Alpha/Beta版的测试人员
It's good to know that users who are alpha or beta testers

55
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,370
是无法对你的应用进行相关评价的
cannot leave reviews for your app.

56
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,020
通过这种方式  可以有效的防止
In this way, you can protect against leaks

57
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,680
新版本中的内容被泄露出去
about your secret app or harm to your ratings

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,660
也不用担心因测试版存在bug而导致排名下降
if you're beta version still has some bugs.

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,670
不过  你可以在开发者控制台中看到崩溃记录
However, you can still see crash reports, optimization tips,

60
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,220
优化建议和数据统计
and statistics in the Developer Console.

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,330
控制台会把属于不同Alpha/Beta版的数据
And we explicitly mark out results

62
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,160
都明确的标记出来
that pertain to your alpha or beta test.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,530
举个例子  你可以很快速地就能拿到
So for example, you can quickly isolate all application crashes

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,660
Beta版测试时的崩溃报告
that your beta testers are experiencing.

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,900
通过测试能更有助于
Your beta testers are great for identifying

66
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,210
帮你发现bug和使用上的问题
bugs and the usability problems.

67
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,850
不过还是要注意  他们并不能完全
But keep in mind, they are not a representative sample

68
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,390
代表应用的目标用户
of your target user population.

69
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
如果你的应用在测试组里反馈还算不错
Once your app is looking good to your beta testers,

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,560
并且已经做足了测试
and it has been through a full round of testing on your side,

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,404
那就可以正式发布出去了
it's time to publish.

72
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,070
当应用面向所有用户正式发布之后
Once your app is published to all users,

73
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,430
再对其进行更新升级时  就会有更多的方案供你选择
you will have some options when you roll out your next updates.

74
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,564
在我们Google
Here at Google.

75
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,730
当我们的一款应用推出新版本更新时
We want to be sure that everything goes well when we

76
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,385
我们总是希望应用能够一切正常
roll out new version of our apps.

77
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:20,540
你也一定是这么想的吧
And we know that you do as well.

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,440
为此  我们推出了分阶段发布模式
For this, we design staged rollouts.

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
你可以先向一定比例的用户提供应用更新
You can rollout updates of your app

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
比如说5%的用户
to just a percentage of your users, like 5%,

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,430
随着时间的推移
and then crank it up to 100% when

82
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,310
如果发现反馈一切良好  并且没出现什么问题
you can see that the reviews are still good,

83
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,830
再将更新比例逐步扩大到100%
and there are no problems on the horizon.

84
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,070
在分阶段发布模式下  如果你意识到
Don't panic, if you realize that you rolled out a bad version

85
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,340
你推出了一个糟糕的版本  不要慌
while a staged rollout is still in progress.

86
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,860
把bug修复  再发布一个新版本即可
Spin up a bug fix and publish a new version.

87
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,000
新版本会只推送给装有bug版本的用户
Your fix will go out to the users who have the bad one,

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,510
应用的发布进程也得以持续下去
and you can resume the rollout.

89
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,710
至此  我们已经把应用的发布过程中该注意的事情讨论完了
Now that I covered the publishing process, let's focus

90
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,140
现在让我们看一下应用的监测吧
on monitoring how your app is doing.

91
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,740
在Google  我们认为  只有那些
Here at Google we think that the developers do best

92
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,940
对自己的用户和应用的表现有敏锐洞察力的开发者们才能够取得成功
when they have lots of insights into their users and app performance.

93
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,640
许多取得成功的开发者们都会说
Most successful developers tell us

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,570
他们每天都登录开发者控制台
that they log into the Developer Console

95
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,740
检视应用的统计数据  各种评价
every day to check on their statistics, reviews,

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,880
以及优化建议
and optimization tips.

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,560
这是由开发者控制台生成的
Here's an overview of some of the types of data

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,440
一个数据概览
that is offered in the Developer Console

99
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,560
我们希望开发者们都应该留意一下
that we think more developers should be looking at.

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,610
最基础的
Starting from the basics, most of you

101
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,950
你可以在开发者控制台看到
know that you can see installs and the uninstalls

102
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,930
指定日期范围内应用的安装量和卸载量
over time in the Developer Console.

103
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,460
另外  在统计信息页里
In addition to that, if you just go to the statistics page,

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,440
你可以看到应用在一段时间内的评分变化  崩溃趋势
you can see how your app ratings have changed over time, crash

105
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,940
和有效用户人数
trends and if you link your Developer Console

106
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,230
前提是将开发者控制台与Google Analytics（分析）帐户进行了关联
account with Google Analytics, data about your active users,

107
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,320
还能看到用户互动度
and their engagement with your app.

108
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
别忘了看一下App Version里的内容
Be sure to click on app version to make

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,290
以确保能进行应用新旧版本之间的对比
sure you compare your new versions against the older ones.

110
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,390
同样还可以以SCV格式导出
Also use the CSV exports to download the full data set

111
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,485
并下载完整的数据
beyond the first top 10 values.

112
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,610
如果你是一名游戏开发者并且使用Google Play游戏服务的话
If you're a game developer and you use Google Play Games

113
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,590
利用几周前我们刚刚发布的最新的游戏统计模块
Services in your app, you can monitor your game performance

114
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,610
你可以时刻监测游戏的业绩
and key player metrics using the new game stats module

115
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,560
以及核心玩家的各项指标
that we just launched a few weeks ago.

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,390
应用崩溃是一个很重要的问题
Crashes can be a major problem.

117
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,980
它们会令用户感到不满
They make users unhappy and dissatisfied.

118
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,990
也会导致应用收到一系列的差评
They can result in bad reviews and users

119
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,210
最后用户忍无可忍只能卸载掉
uninstalling your app in frustration.

120
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,915
所以我们花了大把的时间让开发者控制台中的
So we have spent time making the crash reporting feature

121
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:17,520
崩溃报告功能变得更加完善
in the Developer Console even better.

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,310
你可以查看不同版本号下
You can check on your beta test and your stage rollout

123
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,390
测试版和分阶段发布版的崩溃报告
by filtering your crashes by version.

124
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,590
并且还可以理清
You can also see how these crashes break

125
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,880
这些崩溃都来自于哪几种设备和哪些Android版本
down across different devices and Android versions

126
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,610
这样就可以搞清楚问题到底出在了哪
to make it easier to track down what's going wrong

127
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,130
也能让你知道为什么总有那么几种机型的用户在抱怨
or why users on a certain device are complaining.

128
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,220
如果你开发本地代码的话
If you develop a native code, we have improved the reporting

129
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,280
我们特地针对本地崩溃完善了报告形式
and presentation, specifically for native crashes,

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,380
更好的将相似的崩溃加以归类
with better clustering of similar crashes

131
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,190
并得出结论信息
and summarizing of relevant information.

132
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,500
而且  崩溃的收集是实时的
Also, remember that we collect crashes in real time,

133
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,660
所以在发布了你的分阶段发布版或者测试版之后
so you can monitor your staged rollout or beta version

134
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,860
紧接着就可以开始监测了
minutes after publishing it.

135
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,810
最后  优化建议会告诉你应用可进行优化的途径
Finally, optimization tips show you new ways

136
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,810
它是为你的应用和用户量身打造的
that you can improve, tailored to your own apps and users.

137
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,080
从添加翻译  到确保你的应用在移动设备上工作正常
From adding translations, making sure your app works well

138
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,980
再到确认使用的Google服务是否是最新版本
on tablets and ensuring your app is using the latest

139
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,480
它应有尽有
versions of the Google services you integrate with.

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,090
如果应用在安装量  卸载量
We also help you out with alerts,

141
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,300
评分  或者崩溃数上发生显著变化
letting you know if there's been a big change in your installs,

142
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,510
我们会向你发送提醒
uninstalls, ratings, or crashes.

143
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,130
有了提醒机制
With alerts, you can trust Google to alert you

144
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,210
你完全可以信任Google在事件发生的第一时间就通知到你
whenever a relevant event occurs.

145

150
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,370
首先  研究并确定你的目标用户
a quality app-- research and identify your target audience,

151
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,690
在开发阶段
collect early feedback by your beta testers

152
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,980
通过发布测试尽早的收集反馈
while development is still in progress,

153
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,720
利用分阶段发布模式达到零风险发布
do risk-free releases with stage rollouts,

154
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,710
另外  利用Google Play提供的相关数据
and keep optimizing your app with the data

155
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,680
不断优化你的应用
that Google Play makes available to you.

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,750
让我们行动起来吧
