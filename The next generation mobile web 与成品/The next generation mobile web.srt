1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,399


2
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:06,190
Hi
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Hi.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,780
欢迎大家
Welcome.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,529
我们的直播
So we're going to get started before we're

5
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,530
即将开始
all full in this room just for the live stream.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,440
我是 Alex Komoroske
I'm Alex Komoroske.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,169
Chrome web平台开发组的产品经理
I'm lead product manager on Chrome's web platform team.

8
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,210
Hi
ELISABETH MORANT: And hi.

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,880
我是 Elisabeth Morant
My name is Elisabeth Morant and I am the product manager

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,714
Chrome 安全团队的产品经理
for Chrome security.

11
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:20,254
我们今天将要讨论四个话题
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So today, we're going

12
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,030
有新也有旧
to tell you about four forces, some of them old, some of them

13
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,420
我们把它融合在一起
new, that together combine to create

14
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,580
创造出下一代移动互联网
the next generation mobile web.

15
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,010
我们将在此
Now, a lot of times at I/O, we tell you

16
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,920
告诉你们一些新奇的特性
about all kinds of amazing features

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,730
它们会在6个月后和大家见面  也许是一年之后
that are going to come six months, maybe a year from now,

18
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,390
但是今天  我们将要揭开某些特性的面纱
but today, we're going to cover only things that are already

19
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,370
并且在Chrome上你们已经可以使用
shipped in Chrome that you can use.

20
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,960
由于时间有限  所以我们只涵盖了
So we don't have that much time, so we'll cover things

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,510
一些很高层面的东西  
at a pretty high level, but there's

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,670
但是仍然有很多高质量的DevByte以及Box Talk
lots of great DevBytes and Box Talks

23
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,585
供大家在IO上参加
here at I/O that go into more depth on all of these.

24
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:50,429
让我们开始吧
So let's get started.

25
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,220
Elisabeth和我能站在这的原因只有一个
So the reason that Elisabeth and I are here

26
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,801
那就是我们都爱Chrome
is because we love Chrome.

27
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:55,300
和大家一样  我们爱Chrome
ELISABETH MORANT: And we love Chrome

28
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,147
是因为我们都爱web
because, like many of you, we love the web.

29
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:58,980
Web的神奇之处在于
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I mean, it's kind of amazing

30
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,020
你可以不通过任何人的允许
that you can connect with any topic or community you want

31
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,099
就可以连接任何一个主题或者是社区
without asking anyone permission,

32
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,110
让一切神奇的事情得以发生
which allows all kinds of wacky stuff to happen.

33
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,930
我个人最喜欢的站点
So my personal favorite is this site

34
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,560
叫做Real Ultimate Power
called Real Ultimate Power.

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,984
有人知道它吗
Anybody know what that is?

36
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,400
我看到你了
So there's a few of you out there.

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,020
这是一个讽刺类的主题站点
So this is this amazing satire site.

38
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,870
这位老兄有一个关于忍者的页面
This guy has a page about ninjas.

39
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,147
他对忍着超级痴迷并且痛恨海盗
He's super crazy into ninjas and he hates pirates.

40
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,480
当然
ELISABETH MORANT: Oh, of course.

41
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,030
这才是重点
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's important.

42
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,540
他把网页挂在那
But he just put this site up there.

43
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,170
人们都捧腹大笑
People thought it was hilarious.

44
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,620
纷纷的去分享它
They shared it.

45
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,210
发现并喜欢它
People found it and loved it.

46
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,630
我们团队也非常喜欢这个
My crew team, we actually found it

47
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,344
以至于也摆pose拍了张照片
and loved it so much that we actually posed

48
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,510
上传到这个站点上面
for a picture as ninjas and uploaded it to the site.

49
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,710
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

50
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,350
你必须给大家看看这张照片
You have to show everyone this photo.

51
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,740
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

52
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,365
我也试图那样做了
I'm trying to psych myself up for that,

53
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:43,620
但是这照片真是有点年头了
but here's the picture that I am extremely

54
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,612
至今也引以为傲
proud of from a number of years ago.

55
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:47,070
哪一个是你
ELISABETH MORANT: Which one is you?

56
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,100
我也不是太确定
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So I'm actually not entirely sure,

57
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,550
但是看到了古铜色的皮肤
but based on the farmer's tan, I'm

58
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,800
我确定那个就是我
pretty sure that that one's me.

59
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,220
无论如何  我囧了 这次该轮到你囧了
Anyway, I embarrassed myself, you embarrass yourself.

60
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,485
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

61
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:56,985
All right.

62
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,800
我想这样才是公平
I guess it's only fair.

63
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,980
当我12岁的时候  极度痴迷于视频游戏
So when I was 12, I was really into video games, especially

64
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,540
尤其是冒险类游戏  所以我上网并制作了
adventure games, so I took to the internet

65
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,090
我的第一个网站
to make my first website.

66
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,300
这也是我第一次接触编程
And clearly, this was my first introduction to programming

67
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,710
网页中间还有一个巨大的空间
and I owned up to it with the giant space in the bottom

68
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,504
我根本不知道怎么把它去掉
that I didn't know how to get rid of.

69
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,670
非常巧妙
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Very subtle.

70
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,520
但是正是这一次
ELISABETH MORANT: But the point is

71
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,300
才真正的把我和那些
that this let me connect with this huge community of people

72
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,197
具有相同热情的人一起联系起来
out there who had the same passions as I did.

73
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,780
是的  大约400多个呢
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah, all 400 of them,

74
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,110
如果计数器没错的话
if I see that counter right.

75
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,210
其实多半都是我自己刷的
ELISABETH MORANT: Half of them were me refreshing the page.

76
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,530
无论如何这只是一些简单的例子
Anyway, so these are just a few weird examples,

77
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,730
但是web确实是一个强大的技术
but the web is a really powerful technology

78
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,180
它开启了一个昌盛的经济时代
that's enabled a number of very thriving businesses to form.

79
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,715
电子商务在2014年的成交额已经超过了1.5万亿
E-commerce alone in 2014 was worth more than $1.5 trillion.

80
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:45,590
我的天
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Jeez.

81
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,700
数额非常之巨大
ELISABETH MORANT: That's huge.

82
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,600
T级别的万亿
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's trillion with a T.

83
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,530
是的
ELISABETH MORANT: Yes.

84
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,363
Wow
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

85
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,8007
我们分享了一些过去的例子
So the point of this is we've shared some examples

86
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,220
但是不局限于此
from our past, but we're not alone.

87
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,490
事实上   我敢说这个房间里参与直播的每一个人
In fact, I bet that almost everyone in this room

88
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,480
都已经连上了网
and on the live stream has a connection to the web.

89
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,880
我们都是这个奇妙而强大的全球化社区
It's this amazing, vibrant, weird, global community

90
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,090
其中的一员
that we're all a part of.

91
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,645
这太棒了
It's awesome.

92
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:05,520
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

93
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,370
今天的主题是下一代移动网络
So the title of the talk is the next generation mobile web, so

94
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,790
那么我们在移动端上面都能做什么呢
what are we doing on mobile?

95
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,456
问的好
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's a great question.

96
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,050
移动端是一个重大的改变
So mobile was a fundamental shift.

97
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,820
它由桌面端演化而来
It changed the assumptions from desktop.

98
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,610
所以性能就显得格外重要
So performance became incredibly important,

99
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,820
确保设备上能够达到60fps
making sure that you could hit 60 frames per second

100
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,170
在设备使用电池的情况下
on devices that were running battery power.

101
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,660
并且还有其他功能
And there's other capabilities that

102
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,900
让情况变得更加严峻
just became totally critical.

103
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,920
举个例子  推送通知
Push notifications, for example, are

104
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,340
让你和自己设备进行交互
just crucial to how you interact with your mobile device

105
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,170
web不能做到这些
and the web couldn't do it.

106
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,950
事实上  本地应用就非常的
To be honest, native apps really just

107
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,860
适合这种环境
were well suited to this environment.

108
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,330
ELISABETH MORANT: All right.

109
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,860
你的意思是我们都该去开发本地应用
So I guess we should all just make native apps, then?

110
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,830
我可没说
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I'm not saying that.

111
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,370
如今本地应用非常的出色   但是web也一样毫不逊色
Now, native apps are great, but the web is also amazing.

112
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,080
事实上  它所拥有的一些优点
In fact, a number of its strengths

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,060
让其在桌面端更加的强大
that made it so strong on desktop are as strong as ever.

114
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,100
有一天我查看了下
So just the other day I looked, and I

115
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,590
在过去的一周里有多少人使用Devtool
checked to see how many people used DevTools in the past week.

116
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,020
相比来说  
So as a point of comparison, Android

117
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,260
Android是一个比较成功的平台
is an amazingly successful platform.

118
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,280
我看到公共统计大约有4百万
I've seen public stats somewhere around four million

119
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,230
而开发者大约则是1百万
or so for an estimate for developers.

120
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,580
你猜有多少人使用了Chrome DevTools
So how many people do you think loaded Chrome DevTools

121
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,340
在过去的一周
in the past week?

122
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,460
一周吗
ELISABETH MORANT: A week?

123
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,700
也许有1百万吧
Maybe a million.

124
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,200
揭晓答案
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Turns out the answer

125
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,390
大约有250万的人使用Chrome DevTools
is 25 million people have used Chrome

126
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,149
在过去的一周
DevTools in the last week.

127
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,959
非常的酷因为这不是一个死的数字
That's really cool because that's not a stagnant number.

128
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,240
仍然一直在增长
That's actually growing over time.

129
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,510
所以这些人并不是都在构造
So the point is not all these people

130
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,950
巨大而又复杂的网站
are building huge, complicated websites.

131
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,145
其中的一些人只是在修修补补
Some of them are tinkering.

132
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,600
我们是这个巨大社区中的一份子
But this community that we're all a part of, it's huge, it's

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
它在不断的变强变大
strong, and it's growing.

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,850
所以今天的演讲就是针对这些
So this talk today is for those people

135
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,210
处在这个社区中  并且热爱web的250万人
in this community, those 25 million people who

136
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,050
而说的
love the web.

137
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,261 
[APPLAUSE]

138
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,760
一开始
ELISABETH MORANT: So to start, we're

139
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,477
我们谈论了它的范围  以及web的超强力量
going to talk about reach, the superpower of the web.

140
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:54,060
我们也聊了一些性能方面的问题
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We're also then talk about performance and how

141
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,710
以及因此产生的巨大变革
we made big strides there.

142
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,290
最后
ELISABETH MORANT: And finally, we're

143
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,040
我们将要谈谈  以及
going to talk about engagement, how we're

144
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,130
我们如何帮助你创造出拟真的体验
helping you build immersive experience that

145
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,000
让用户回来
keep users coming back.

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,430
这三个话题虽说是分开的
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the three of these separately, whatever.

147
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,520
但是联系在一起  与全球化社区相结合起来
But together, combined with that global community,

148
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,890
就变得非常的特别了
that's something special.

149
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,450
Web以及它的成功
ELISABETH MORANT: So the web is extremely successful,

150
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,180
不仅是因为它范围之广
largely because of its reach, and we

151
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,450
don't give it enough credit.

152
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,770
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I mean, we give it a fair bit of credit.

153
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,870
我们都知道浏览器能运行在每一个设备
We understand that browsers are on every device

154
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,420
以及每一个操作系统上
and every operating system.

155
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,670
没错
ELISABETH MORANT: That's true.

156
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,590
甚至现在汽车上都有浏览器  我们有超过十亿的Chrome用户
Even now cars have browsers and we have over one billion Chrome

157
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,120
这还不算那些
users, and that doesn't even count

158
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,255
其他的浏览器以及通过它浏览Web的人
other browsers and other people browsing the web.

159
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:33,680
但是我要谈的是关于范围的另外一方面
But what I'm talking about is another aspect

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,470
不是浏览器的范围
of reach, that is, not the reach of browsers

161
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,220
而是内容的范围
but the reach of content.

162
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,360
我思考的方式则是把Web想象成一棵
So the way I think about it is the web

163
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,860
拥有很多节点的树
is a series of trees with nodes, right,

164
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,570
每一个网页都是一棵树  而树根
where every website is a tree and the root is

165
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,376
则是像Pinterest.com之类的站点
like Pinterest.com, and then you dig deep,

166
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,250
然后每一个网页就是树的叶子节点
and then you're on a board and that's a leaf.

167
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,630
你从一个URL跳到另一个URL
And then if you jump from URL to URL,

168
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,730
也就是你从一个叶子节点跳到另一个叶子节点
then you're jumping from leaf node to leaf node

169
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,190
如此这般的
and so on and so forth, and that's

170
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,982
这也是为什么能在链接间跳来跳去
why it's so easy jump between link to link.

171
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,648
我真的不明白
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I have literally no idea

172
00:05:58,648 --> 00:05:59,780
你在说什么
what you're talking about.

173
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,140
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

174
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,410
Fair.

175
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,450
让我给你展示个例子
Let me show you an example.

176
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,366
好的
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Great.

177
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:05,930
假如我现在跳到了这个演示的笔记本电脑上
ELISABETH MORANT: So if I could jump to the demo laptop?

178
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,430
Great.

179
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,451
我们打开Imagine Dragons乐队最新的单曲视频
So let's start on a video of the latest Imagine Dragons single,

180
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:10,950
&quot;Shots.&quot;

181
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,680
我想在座的观众里面
So I know that every single one of you in the audience

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
应该会有些人和我一样喜欢Imagine Dragons
loves Imagine Dragons probably not as much as I do.

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,060
这也许是有史以来最棒的乐队
It's basically the best band that's ever existed.

184
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,430
比Beatles好多了
It's better than the Beatles, really.

185
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,020
我要继续演示了
I could go on about it.

186
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,373
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

187
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:20,726
OK.

188
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:21,226
Sure.

189
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:24,710
关键在于web  范围  以及树
ELISABETH MORANT: So the point is the web, reach, trees,

190
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,210
right.

191
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,850
所以Youtube在此就是一棵特别的树
So YouTube is a tree and this particular piece

192
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,240
而视频内容则是一个节点
of video content is a node.

193
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,390
我可以把URL分享给你
And so I could just share a URL with you

194
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,680
然后你就能看到这个内容
and then you can watch this piece of content.

195
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,340
同样的  我也能了解更多关于Imagine Dragon的信息
And likewise, I can learn more about Imagine Dragons,

196
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,640
通过YouTube中的导航链接  或许你可以跳到维基百科
navigate through YouTube, maybe jump to Wikipedia.

197
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,810
这样的话  我就是从其中一个节点跳到了
At this point, I've jumped from one node

198
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,210
另外维基百科这棵树的节点上面
to the node of another tree, the Wikipedia tree,

199
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,910
我也可以获得维基百科上面深层次的内容
and I so easily reached a piece of content deep in Wikipedia

200
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,870
只需点击一下链接
just by clicking a link.

201
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,090
从这里我可以阅读一些文章
And so from here, I can read some articles,

202
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,580
来回的跳转  了解Alt-J  再跳回来
jump around, learn about Alt-J, jump back.

203
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,970
我并没有带你浏览完
I'm not going to bring you through the entirety

204
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,840
整个网络
of the web.

205
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,740
那会花相当长的时间
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That would take a long time.

206
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,031
我能跳转到他们的乐队主页
ELISABETH MORANT: And I can jump to their band website.

207
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,890
这种情况下  我就不需要
In this case, I wouldn't necessarily

208
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,610
那些每一个我喜欢乐队的应用了
want an app for every band that I love,

209
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,010
我只需要去他们的网站就行了
but I do want to be able to go to their website

210
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,380
了解一些信息  比如查看什么时候开巡演之类的
and learn about things like when they're going on tour

211
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,480
Alex
and find out-- hey, Alex?

212
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,460
怎么了
ALEX KOMOROSKE: What?

213
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,940
你能等一下吗
ELISABETH MORANT: Can you take over for a second?

214
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,580
他们正在开巡演
I just-- they're on tour and I know

215
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
并且票已经快要卖光了
the tickets are going to sell out

216
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,220
我需要现在就买上一张
and I just really need to buy a ticket right now.

217
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,810
你逗我呢吧
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Are you kidding me?

218
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,330
就一会儿
ELISABETH MORANT: Please?

219
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,360
你知道slide的
You know the slides.

220
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,820
好
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

221
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,940
事实上我也可以跳转到WolfVision
ELISABETH MORANT: Actually, can we jump to WolfVision

222
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,870
这样我就能和所有人分享买票的这个经历了
so everyone can share in this experience of buying tickets

223
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,400
with me?

224
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,590
Wow
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

225
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,230
看来你真是Imagine Dragons的铁杆粉
You really love Imagine Dragons.

226
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,959
我爱Imagine Dragons
ELISABETH MORANT: I love Imagine Dragons.

227
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,750
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

228
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,458
她正在做的这件事
While she's doing that, it's kind of cool

229
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,502
这真是一件非常酷的事情
what she was doing.

230
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,960
在几十秒钟内
In the course of a few seconds, she

231
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,250
她先后浏览了大约七种不同的服务
visited what, like seven different services,

232
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,920
都没有安装任何的东西
all without installing anything.

233
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,100
非常棒
That's kind of cool.

234
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
这一切在web上
It's something that just happens that we totally

235
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,977
就好像理所当然一样
take for granted on the web.

236
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,310
抱歉
ELISABETH MORANT: Anyway, sorry.

237
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,810
我回来了
I'm back.

238
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,310
我回来了
I'm back.

239
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,312
我回来了
I'm back, guys.

240
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,270
票现在还没开卖
So it turns out the tickets aren't on sale yet,

241
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,300
所以我到了它们的网站
so I just went to their website and opted

242
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,090
选择了售票时通知我
to get a notification when they come back on sale.

243
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,960
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

244
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,956
我们刚才谈到哪里了
ELISABETH MORANT: Anyway, so where were we?

245
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:14,107
我们能回到之前的那页slide吗?
Can we go back to the slides?

246
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,065
关于范围的
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Something about reach, I think.

247
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:17,190
ELISABETH MORANT: Oh right.

248
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,740
Friction.

249
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,650
Friction sucks, friction being the amount of overhead

250
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,340
from a user wanting to get somewhere to actually being

251
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,910
able to get to that piece of content, and on the web,

252
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,749
它就像点击链接一样简单
it's as easy as just tapping a link.

253
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:30,540
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

254
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,669
我想我知道这是怎么一回事了
So I think I see what's going on here

255
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,154
但是这似乎太抽象了
but this seems all really abstract.

256
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:36,320
你能举一个实际的例子吗
Is this something that actually matters in practice?

257
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,278
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

258
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:39,240
例子来了
So here's something.

259
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,550
平均每个用户每个月大约使用12到20个应用
On average, the average person uses around 12 to 20 apps

260
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,500
在他们的手机上
per month on their phone.

261
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,120
取决于你用的哪一个统计数据了
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Depending on which stat you use.

262
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,190
是的取决于你看的哪一个数据源
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah, depending on what source

263
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,270
you look at.

264
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,760
猜一猜Chrome for Android 用户
So keeping that in mind, guess how many sites

265
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,829
平均每月要访问多少个站点
the average Chrome for Android user visits in every month.

266
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:56,620
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

267
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,170
也包括第三方内容以及页面吗
So are we including third party content and iframes and stuff?

268
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,270
不
ELISABETH MORANT: No.

269
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,160
就只是直接的导航链接
I'm talking about direct link navigation,

270
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,550
通过Omnibox
going through the Omnibox.

271
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,980
都是些不同的域名
This is all unique domains.

272
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,771
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

273
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,960
使用12到20个应用的话
So 12 to 20 for apps.

274
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,860
那么这个应该是那个的两倍 40个
Maybe double that, like 40 or so.

275
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,117
超过100个网站
ELISABETH MORANT: Over 100 websites a month.

276
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:12,950
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

277
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,040
这真蛮令人震惊
That's actually really impressive.

278
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,090
我从未意识到有这么大
I didn't realize it was going to be that big.

279
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,430
看见了吗
ELISABETH MORANT: See?

280
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,930
这就是web所能触及的范围
That right there is reach in action.

281
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,850
人们可以通过简单的点击
It's so easy for people to just tap a link

282
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,090
就访问数以万计的站点
and visit tons of new sites with no friction.

283
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,070
事实上美国运营商的移动流量
And in fact, it turns out that 85% of US retailers'

284
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,110
占到了Web流量的85%
mobile traffic is on the web, and that accounts

285
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,307
并且占它们收入的90%以上
for 90% of their revenue.

286
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,140
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

287
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,264
这仅仅只是一个例子
ELISABETH MORANT: And now this is just one example,

288
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:35,880
这也是我为什么说Web有着超强的力量
and this is why I consider reach the superpower of the web.

289
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,960
所以我的结论就是
So the way I think of it is-- bear with me-- you want people

290
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,410
如果你想要人们和你的东西产生联系
to form a meaningful relationship with your stuff,

291
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,570
人们必须得能发现它
but first people have to find it.

292
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,100
Web就像一个巨大的速配会
So it's kind of like the web is one big speed dating venue

293
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,890
你可以从一个人跳到另外一个人
where you can jump from person to person and get to know them

294
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,420
一点一点的接触他  就像你从一个站点跳到另一个站点一样
a little bit, just like you can jump from website to website

295
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,461
在你没和那部分内容建立关系之前
and get to know it a little bit before committing

296
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,310
你就能对它有所了解
and developing a relationship with that content.

297
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,730
你无需担心非得点击一个链接
And you're never afraid to necessarily click

298
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,860
因为最坏的情况下又能发生什么呢
a link because what's the worst that can happen?

299
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,610
五分钟后  铃响了
After five minutes, the bell rings and you

300
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,406
你又要移动到了另外一个地方
move onto the next place.

301
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,030
关键在于只要你想
And the point is that then, when you decide you want to commit,

302
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,450
你就能快速的建立联系
you can build that relationship over time.

303
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,490
这前所未有的重要
And so we take reach for granted but it's really

304
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,962
as important as ever.

305
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,920
这就是Web的延伸范围
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So that's reach, but of course,

306
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,660
和移动端的性能一样重要
just as important on mobile is performance.

307
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,160
但是你又如何去衡量性能
But what does good performance mean?

308
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,710
你怎么知道你做完了并且完成的足够出色
How do you know when you're done and when you're good enough?

309
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,210
非常简单
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, that's easy.

310
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,030
一个页面加载的时间
It's just the amount of time it takes a page to load.

311
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,010
页面加载时间
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So page load time

312
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,301
人尽皆知
is something that we've all known about as a community.

313
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,680
我们把称它为PLT或者是其他
We call it PLT or whatever.

314
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,100
我们有很深的理解  也有强有利的工具
We have good understanding, got good tools.

315
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,047
There's whole conferences on it.

316
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:37,880
这并不是说我们已经很完美了  顺便说
That's not to say we're perfect, by the way.

317
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,588
很多人都不必去亲身体验
There's a lot of us who don't necessarily

318
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:41,240
我们在这说的这些东西
practice what we preach here.

319
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,990
但是移动领域  也有其他的指标
But on mobile, other metrics matter, too,

320
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,115
比如说滚动性能
like scrolling performance.

321
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:47,700
为了实现
To have the illusion that the content is sticking

322
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,310
内容就像随着你手指滚动的错觉
to your finger as you scroll, you've

323
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,660
你必须达到60fps
got to hit 60 frames per second consistently.

324
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,160
但是这些指标哪些是
But which of these metrics should we

325
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,020
值得我们关注并且优化的呢
look at and which one should we be optimizing?

326
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,472
答案就是RAIL
So the answer to that is this concept that we call RAIL.

327
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,180
另外一个缩写
ELISABETH MORANT: Great, another acronym.

328
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,890
当然
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Of course.

329
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,990
就是这个
What did you expect?

330
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,810
它是一个概念
So it's basically a conceptual framework

331
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,380
用来感知什么时候发挥出了出色性能
for knowing when you have good enough performance.

332
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,080
那么什么时候才算性能出色呢
So the key insight is when is performance good enough?

333
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,162
就是用户察觉不到性能的问题的时候
Well, when the user can't perceive it.

334
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:12,370
这才是性能出色
That's when it's good enough.

335
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,770
我感保证Don Draper可没说过那个
ELISABETH MORANT: I'm pretty sure Don Draper didn't actually

336
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,365
say that.

337
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:15,490
好眼力
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Good catch.

338
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,031
据我所知他的确没说过
He didn't say that, as far as I know,

339
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:18,733
但是他说过
but he might have said it if only

340
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,490
如果他想关注某个东西的一方面
he had cared about this kind of stuff.

341
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,865
那么就要为此
But the point is there's actually

342
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,280
做出足够的研究
a lot of research on this.

343
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,050
所以如果你想实现所谓的平滑滚动
So if you're trying to get that illusion of smooth motion,

344
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,300
那么一定得达到60fps
of course you want to hit 60 frames per second,

345
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,850
意味着每一帧至少要16.67毫秒
which means 16.67 milliseconds to put each frame on screen.

346
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,970
而现在  如果你想要用户
Now, if you want to have the user feel

347
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,040
感到这一切都是瞬间完成的
that the thing happened instantaneously,

348
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,060
研究告诉我们至少得100毫秒
research tells us you've got about 100 milliseconds.

349
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,930
如果你在一秒内完成
And if you do something within one second, well then,

350
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,769
人的思路能停留在上面
someone's train of thought can stay on it,

351
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,310
如果你超过了十秒
and if you take more than 10 seconds,

352
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,690
那就能玩纸牌了
well then they're off playing solitaire or something.

353
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,080
肯定超过十秒
ELISABETH MORANT: Definitely took more than 10 seconds.

354
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,121
真是一个好例子
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thank you for that great example.

355
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:56,690
无论如何这有一个黄金法则需要你去遵守
So anyway, these are the golden standard for you to hit,

356
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,320
而RAIL的概念则是为此而生
and RAIL is basically just hitting

357
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,890
专注于web性能
these goals in the context of your web performance.

358
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,150
第一个R代表响应时间
So the first one is R for reaction time.

359
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,740
这是代表
So basically, this is exactly when

360
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,880
从用户开始滑动屏幕上的手指
the user puts their finger down on the glass

361
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,890
再到开始交互的时间
and starts interacting.

362
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,474
你有100毫秒的时间处理事务
You have 100 milliseconds to do something, to show you got it.

363
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,681
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah, sure.

364
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,781
否则的话应用就会感觉卡顿
Otherwise, the app feels broken or slow.

365
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:17,780
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

366
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,560
100毫秒内改变按钮的颜色
So that's 100 milliseconds to change the button color

367
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
或者展示一个进度条
or to show a loading indicator or show, I got it.

368
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,620
证明没有卡住
I'm not frozen.

369
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,660
A代表动画时间
Next one is Animation time.

370
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,470
60帧每秒是黄金法则
You've got, of course, 60 frames per second

371
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,380
意味着每帧16.67毫秒
is the gold standard, which means 16.67 milliseconds.

372
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,470
不算太长
Now, that's not a lot of time, so if you do anything,

373
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,300
你可能会错过  所以一定要格外注意
you might miss that, so you have to really, really careful.

374
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,049
I则是代表空闲
So the next one is Idle.

375
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:43,840
为啥Idle是RAIL的一部分
ELISABETH MORANT: Why is Idle part of RAIL?

376
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,470
你必须得做一些工作
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So you have to do

377
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,280
这要花些时间  比如说渲染图片什么的
some work that's going to take some time, like image decodes

378
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,060
无论如何你不能在用户交互时干这个
or whatever, and you can't do it when the user is interacting,

379
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,046
最佳时间是用户还没把手指
so a good time is when the user doesn't have

380
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:55,170
放在屏幕上
their finger on the screen.

381
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,050
ELISABETH MORANT: Right.

382
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,591
如果用户在你做这些工作的途中
ALEX KOMOROSKE: However, what if the user's finger comes back

383
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,170
手指放回来了会怎样
in while you're doing that work?

384
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,650
我想想
ELISABETH MORANT: I see.

385
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,920
你一定不想在中途发生这个
You don't want to be the middle of idle time

386
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,570
因为这样的话  你就无法完成交互
because otherwise, you're not going to be able to react.

387
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,300
用户会以为卡住了
The user might think the app is broken.

388
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,520
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

389
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,710
所以如果你想确保在没开始与用户交互之前
So you want to make sure you chunk up your work you

390
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,840
也就是Idle阶段
that you even in idle so if at any point

391
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,400
就完成整体的工作
the user starts interacting with you, you're good to go

392
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,170
你最好要抓住那100毫秒的响应时间
and can hit that 100 milliseconds, the R of RAIL.

393
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,100
最后一个  则是加载时间
And the last one, of course, is our friend Load time.

394
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,197
当然  这在移动端仍然是问题
Of course, it still matters, if not more, on mobile.

395
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,030
黄金法则告诉我们
And the gold standard here to keep the train

396
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,782
临界值在1秒
of thought solid is one second.

397
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,990
我希望一切都能载入的那样快
ELISABETH MORANT: I wish everything loaded that fast.

398
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,865
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

399
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:29,920
It's pretty low, right?

400
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,530
请记住  这样才算是完美的性能
Remember, this is for perfect performance,

401
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,450
Quick 和 Service Worker 首次让此
and things like Quick and Service Worker

402
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,590
得以可行
actually make this feasible for the first time.

403
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,070
当然  如果你不能全部的都加载出来
And of course, if you can't get your entire site loaded up

404
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,910
还有一个技巧则是
on screen, well, the next best thing

405
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,200
在屏幕展示一些标识来证明我在加载
is putting reasonable pixels on screen to show I've loaded,

406
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,559
我在努力加载  我没有卡住
I'm working, I'm not just stuck.

407
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,350
一些加载进度条什么的
ELISABETH MORANT: Sure, some loading image.

408
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,890
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

409
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,270
这就是整个的理论
ELISABETH MORANT: So this is all great in theory,

410
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,010
但是实际中又意味着什么呢
but what does it actually mean in practice?

411
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,301
RAIL对于我们来说
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So RAIL is a great conceptual framework

412
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,470
是一个良好的概念性框架
for us across the community.

413
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,980
尤其是对于浏览器厂商
So for browser vendors in particular,

414
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,080
它给予你如开发者般
it means giving you as developers

415
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,690
更多的上升空间  你亲自去操刀你的代码
more headroom, more space for your own code

416
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,990
完成这些工作  这样你就能跨越这些壁垒
to do this work so that you don't cross those boundaries.

417
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,120
Chrome的Web平台团队
So the Chrome Web Platform team is

418
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,450
就是一路过来的  大约有200个工程师
way over-- I think 200 engineers last time I checked.

419
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,100
很多人  并且绝大多数的人
A lot of people, the vast majority,

420
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,630
都在为性能方面努力着
work on some aspect of performance.

421
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,520
我们为此做了大量的工作  以及大量的重构
We've been doing tons of work, vast re-architectures,

422
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,570
旨在优化移动端的性能
to optimize for mobile performance.

423
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,730
我们没有太多的时间去深说其中的每一个
Now, we don't have time to dive into any of these in any depth,

424
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,170
但是让我选其中的一个
but let me just pick one.

425
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,220
两个月前  我们启动了一个新特性
So a couple months ago, we launched this feature

426
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,470
叫做Scheduler
called the Scheduler.

427
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,180
大意是说
And the basic idea is that when you

428
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,890
当你开始和一个界面开始交互的时候
start interacting with a page, that's when, of course,

429
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,390
滚动优先于一切
you want to prioritize scrolling and frames over everything

430
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,260
else.

431
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,324
这样的效果非常显著
And it turns out that this can have a really big impact,

432
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:43,990
尤其是在拥有大量资源要加载
especially during page load when there's

433
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,780
以及工作要做的情况下
lots of work being done.

434
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,740
这里有一个演示视频  打开一个视频界面
So here we've got a video, and if you can roll the video,

435
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,580
左边开启了scheduler  而右边则没有开启
we have on the left with the scheduler, on the right

436
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,390
without.

437
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,300
我们刷新一下重新加载界面
We refresh the page so we're doing tons of work,

438
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,980
你可以非常明显的看到
and you can see the one on the left scrolls way

439
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,740
左边比右边的滑动的更顺滑
more smoothly than the one on the right.

440
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,140
这就是一个由RAIL理念驱动的良好例子
So this is a great example of RAIL motivating work for us

441
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,570
浏览器厂商自动使你的网页
as browser vendors to make your site just

442
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,820
变得更快
get faster automatically.

443
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,276
[APPLAUSE]

444
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:09,776
谢谢
Thanks.

445
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:14,180


446
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,640
下一张slide
So if we can move on to the next slide.

447
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,630
不仅仅是我们自己
So it's not just on us.

448
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,770
我们也为开发者们
It's also on developers that work with us.

449
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,570
提供了良好的工具
And so part of it is better tooling

450
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,880
这样的话你就能轻易的了解性能情况
so that you can understand your own performance really well.

451
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,720
当然  DevTools是一个无比强大的工具
So of course, DevTools is incredibly powerful.

452
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,250
一个你现在可以在Canary 版本里体验到的新特性
A new feature that you can try out in Canary behind the flag

453
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,400
叫做Filmstrip
today is a feature called Filmstrip.

454
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,530
它是怎样工作的呢  你会注意到
So what it does, it shows you-- you can see it up there

455
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,310
那里有一行图片
in that row of images-- it shows what

456
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,380
它展示出了加载页面时
pixels were on screen at different parts

457
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,830
不同时刻的情况
as you loaded the page.

458
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,430
你可以看到
And so you can see here this random cwilso guy,

459
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,870
加载他的博客大约用了8秒
his blog is hitting about eight seconds for the pixels

460
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,640
才完全的体现在屏幕上
to be on screen, which is way past the one

461
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,410
当你想要用RAIL的理念去优化它
second that you want with RAIL.

462
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,460
这样的话  你就需要通过DevTools深挖
And so now, of course, you dig in with DevTools

463
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,620
看看究竟是怎么回事
and figure out what's going on.

464
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,619
所以说DevTools是一个强大的工具
ELISABETH MORANT: So DevTools is really powerful

465
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,930
当时你需要拥有一个PhD才能弄懂他
but you basically need a PhD to understand all of it.

466
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,804
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

467
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:06,870
有时候它的确是压倒性般强大
It's so overwhelmingly powerful sometimes.

468
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,460
我们也在这方面努力
So we're also working on tools that

469
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,660
这样当你打开DevTools
will make it so that you can open up DevTools

470
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,930
它会说hey  你忽略了
and it will say, hey, you're consistently

471
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,640
RAIL规则中的A
missing the A in RAIL.

472
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,520
这个统计功能的第三方脚本
Turns out that this third party script, this analytic script,

473
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,740
妨碍了滚动工作
is doing way too much work on scroll.

474
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,060
你该考虑移走它
Consider removing it.

475
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,020
这样的话就容易多了
And so making it much easier for you to dive in

476
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,112
在你没有拿到PhD的情况下
without having to get a PhD.

477
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,570
最后一个则是
And of course, the last one is just

478
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,400
把我们自己 看成是高标准的
holding ourselves as web developers

479
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,920
web开发者
to a higher standard.

480
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,660
I\O的web应用就是个很好的例子
So the I/O web app is an amazing example

481
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,070
一个高度响应式  能到达60fps的Web应用
of a highly responsive, 60 frames per second web app.

482
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,300
目前这个开发不容易  但是每一天都会变得
Now, it wasn't easy to build but it is getting easier and easier

483
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,550
越来越简单
every day.

484
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,520
对于我们来说
And all of us, every single time we

485
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,930
当我们引入一个第三方的脚本或者是资源
include a third party script or resource

486
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,361
以及从第三方域名上取得的东西
or we fetch out to another third party domain,

487
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:51,110
我们应该问问自己这样值得吗
we should ask ourselves, is this worth it?

488
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,900
用RAIL理念的话会更快吗
Is this going to make me go past those goals in RAIL?

489
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,060
我们花了不少时间谈论性能
So there's only so much time to cover performance.

490
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,190
旨在说明我们已经做到了巨大的进步
The point is that we've made a lot of big strides

491
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,150
我觉得这对于我们来说是一个良好的理念框架
and I think this is a great framework for us

492
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,960
as a community.

493
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,650
Web有着广阔的延伸范围
ELISABETH MORANT: So the web has a superpower of reach,

494
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,270
我们现在已经达到了60fps  即使是对于一些
and now it's possible to have 60 frames per second, even

495
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,420
非常复杂的移动应用
for the most complex mobile apps,

496
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,390
但是web所缺少的则是
but what the web is missing is the ability

497
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,319
帮助用户和那些他们真正需要的内容
for users to build meaningful relationships with the stuff

498
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,653
构建起联系的能力
that they find to really engage.

499
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:18,527
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

500
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:19,902
速配虽好
So I mean, speed dating is great.

501
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:22,568
你会在短时间内遇见各式各样的人
You meet a whole bunch of people in a very short amount of time,

502
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,260
但是如果你和你遇到的人
but what if you meet that person and you

503
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,020
都碰不出火花呢
got a little bit of a spark?

504
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,039
你不想深入的了解他们
You want to get to know them a little bit.

505
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,580
的确  本地应用在此做的就比较好
ELISABETH MORANT: Exactly, and native apps are great at this.

506
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:29,830
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

507zuoda
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,690
我有个主意
I've got an idea.

508
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,231
我们为什么不把
Why don't we just list all the things

509
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,439
本地应用能做到的移植到Web上面
native apps can do and just copy that for the web?

510
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,480
看着简单
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, I wish it were that easy.

511
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
问题是
The problem is that with every new API also

512
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,260
也会带来全新的风险
comes a whole new set of risks, and we

513
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,980
我们要保证Web的安全性
want to maintain the security guarantees

514
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,390
以及不能让用户从一个链接跳转到另一个链接时
of the web, the ability for users to jump to a link

515
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,820
承担相关的风险
and not worry that something's going to happen to them.

516
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,560
举个例子  后台同步
So let's take, for example, background sync, background

517
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,050
后台同步得以在应用关闭的情况下
sync being the ability for an app to fetch and send content

518
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,300
与服务器交换数据
when the app is closed.

519
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,759
如果你每一个月浏览超过100个站点
So if you're visiting over 100 sites a month,

520
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,300
你当然不愿意让它们在后台
then you don't necessarily want them all to arbitrarily start

521
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,840
随意的进行同步
syncing the background.

522
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,700
比如说你在家浏览一些令人尴尬的站点
Just like let's say you browse some embarrassing sites

523
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,630
比如明星八卦绯闻什么的
at home, like some celebrity gossip site.

524
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,577
我当然不是说Alex热衷于
I'm not going to call what celebrity Alex is

525
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:13,160
明星绯闻哈
obsessed with.

526
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Guilty.

527
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,150
然后你要去工作了
ELISABETH MORANT: And then you go to work,

528
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,900
于此同时你手机没有电了
and in the meantime, your phone lost battery.

529
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,520
当你工作时你打开了它  瞬间
You turn it on when you get to work, and all of a sudden,

530
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,686
后台开始同步那些令人尴尬的信息
you start fetching embarrassing content while you're

531
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,009
在你的企业网络里
on your corporate network.

532
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,800
我们试图拯救那些像Alex一样
Well, we're trying to save people like Alex

533
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,099
从浏览一个尴尬站点再到被叫进主管办公室的那些人
from an embarrassing visit to the sys admin's office.

534
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:26,890
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

535
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,900
我知道了
I get that.

536
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,890
我明白了
I see.

537
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,056
让我们回到刚才的那个速配比喻
ELISABETH MORANT: And so basically, if we bring back

538
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,020
假如说
the speed dating metaphor, let's say

539
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,380
你第一次遇见了一个
that you meet someone for the first time

540
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,660
可以碰撞出火花并且你觉得
and you really feel that spark and you think,

541
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,030
这就是你要找的那一个
this could be the one.

542
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,902
你会给她们你公寓的钥匙吗
Do you give them the keys to your apartment,

543
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:43,110
或者是带她见家长  半跪着求婚
introduce them to your parents, bend down on one knee

544
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,790
并且发誓要彼此共度余生吗
and vow to spend the rest of your life together?

545
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yes.

546
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,105
ELISABETH MORANT: No.

547
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:47,670
当然不
Of course not.

548
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,750
天啊  那可能会是一个连环杀手
Jeez, that could be a serial killer.

549
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,580
你需要的是慢慢的培养出感情
So the idea is that you want to build a relationship slowly.

550
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,110
问题在于我们无法效仿  或者是把本地应用的强大模型
The problem is that we can't necessarily emulate or copy

551
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,780
复制过来
the powerful model of native apps

552
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,840
因为本地应用有商店  它们有运维团队
because native apps have a store, they have ops teams,

553
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,360
而web则是开放的
and the web is open.

554
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,720
我们想做的
And so what we want to do is enable

555
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,130
只是逐渐的开启Web请求使用
websites to progressively ask permission

556
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,270
更加强大特性的权限
for powerful and engaging features.

557
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,810
应该由用户表明
And the idea is that users should

558
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,710
什么时候他们想信任该站点
be able to indicate when they want

559
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,390
并且给予相关的权限
to trust this site enough to give them certain permissions.

560
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,240
如果每一个人都能访问到你的银行账户
Basically, if everyone got access to your bank account

561
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,030
只要你见到他们的时候
as soon as you met them, you probably

562
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,480
你可能一步都不会离开你的家门
wouldn't want to leave your house.

563
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,520
相比于拥有这些能力
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So it's more important for the reach

564
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,480
为你保留Web的广度
of the web than to have all these capabilities

565
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,860
比此更加的重要
for every random site you go to.

566
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,250
ELISABETH MORANT: Exactly.

567
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,420
明白了
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Got it.

568
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,795
所以说
ELISABETH MORANT: And so the idea

569
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:35,230
这些新API也会带来全新的风险
is that with all these new APIs come a set of risks,

570
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,380
Chrome有这个责任来确保
and Chrome has this responsibility

571
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,089
每一个用户浏览的网页都是安全的
to make sure that people can still browse the web securely.

572
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:42,630
从这个角度说
Now, with this in mind, we've already

573
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,600
我们已经把部分API带到了Web上
brought a few exciting APIs to the web

574
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,530
我们今天谈谈其中的两个
and we're going to talk about two of them right now.

575
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,800
第一个是添加到主屏幕
The first is Add to Homescreen.

576
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,440
打字  尤其是在移动端上
So typing, especially on a mobile,

577
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,482
是非常困难的  但是移动端也是人们消磨时间最多的地方
is really hard, but mobile is where people go to kill time.

578
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,690
当你到咖啡厅去
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So, I mean, you go to the coffee shop

579
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,523
和你朋友见面的时候
to meet your friend.

580
00:19:58,523 --> 00:19:59,564
他们还没到
They aren't there yet.

581 
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,480
你想读一些有趣的东西
You want to read something interesting but not

582
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,830
但是又很无趣因为随时他们都可能会出现
too interesting because at any point they might show up

583
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,850
你必须把你的手机放在一边
and you have to put your phone away.

584
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,933
ELISABETH MORANT: Exactly.

585
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,190
你可以打开你的手机  点击一个图标
So you open up your phone, you tap an icon,

586
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,700
然后你沉浸其中
and you fall into some experience

587
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,690
你随时都可以退回来
that you're OK jumping back out of again.

588
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,210
我们早已为用户推出了这个
And so we already have the ability for people

589
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,890
添加站点到主屏幕的特性
to add sites to their home screen.

590
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,800
它在设置里的层级很深
It's buried deep in the settings,

591
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,634
但是我们发现它却有着超高的使用率
but we found it had surprisingly high usage.

592
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:25,258
我们为什么不能弄得更加明显些
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So why don't we just make that way more obvious

593
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,592
这样就不容易被忽略了
and make it really hard to miss?

594
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,966
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, if people

595
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,550
如果人们每月访问100个网站的话
are visiting 100 websites every month,

596
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,300
并不是每个都是有用的
then probably every new help form you go to,

597
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,860
你不必都想把它填到主屏幕上
you don't want to necessarily add it to your home screen.

598
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,700
我们的做法是利用一些真正智能启发性机制
And so what we've done is we've incorporated some really smart

599
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,490
开发者可以使用这个API
heuristics and said developers can use this API

600
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,520
让应用请求被添加到主屏上面
and request to be added to the home screen

601
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,190
只要用户和应用有着足够充分的接触
as long as people have in each with the app enough

602
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,410
我们就能检测到用户的确是想把那个应用
that we've detected that they actually want

603
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,890
添加到主屏幕上
that app on their home screen.

604
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,170
我举个例子
So take this as an example.

605
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,920
我非常喜欢阅读Vice News
I really enjoy reading Vice News,

606
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,050
这周的早些时候我阅读了一篇文章
and I read an article earlier this week.

607
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,060
并且早上我又打开了
And this morning I opened it up again,

608
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,990
我发现收到了是否把Vice News 
And I found that I got this prompt from Vice to add

609
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,749
添加到主屏幕上的请求
the website to my home screen.

610
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:06,540
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

611
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,539
非常酷  但是要是你在没联网的情况下
That's awesome, but what happens if you tap that

612
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,950
打开它会怎样
and you don't have connectivity?

613
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,680
你肯定不想看到的是
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, what you don't

614
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,210
那个可怕的离线小恐龙
want to see is the dreaded offline dinosaur,

615
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,020
然而本地应用在这方面处理的就非常的好
and so native apps actually handle this case very well.

616
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,790
即使是一个只有网络连接才能工作的应用
Even if an app depends on connectivity to work,

617
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,230
它们通常会有一个屏幕界面说
they usually have some sort of splash screen saying,

618
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,420
sorry 你还不能使用这个  稍后回来
sorry, you can't use this, but come back later,

619
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,826
等等对应用一些的自定义
something custom to the app.

620
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,450
出于这个原因  我们只对
And for that reason, we've only enabled

621
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,040
那些拥有良好离线体验的站点
Add to Homescreen for those sites that

622
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,840
开启了添加到主屏幕的功能
have a meaningful offline experience.

623
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,760
所以说
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Which is a great point

624
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,830
离线体验格外重要
that offline is an incredibly important thing

625
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,910
尤其是对于在移动网络上创造出色体验来说
for building engaging experiences on mobile web.

626
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,240
在你的移动设备上
So obviously, on your mobile devices,

627
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,100
你更可能出现连接不稳定或者是无连接的情况
you're way more likely to have a flaky connectivity

628
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,190
比如参加了Wi-Fi坏掉了的
or no connectivity, like being at a tech conference where

629
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,700
一个技术会议
the Wi-Fi doesn't work exactly as it should.

630
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,740
这也是一个历史性问题
The problem is that historically, we've only

631
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,150
我们只能通过应用缓存来解决
had App Cache to handle this.

632
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,630
应用缓存有什么问题吗
ELISABETH MORANT: So what's the problem with App Cache?

633
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,900
应用缓存还不是那么的流行
ALEX KOMOROSKE: App Cache wasn't exactly very popular.

634
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,070
非常容易上手  很好
So it was easy to get started, which is great,

635
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,480
and it's declarative, which is also great,

636
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,190
但是却有几分复杂
but it's kind of complex.

637
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,822
如果你做的事情比较复杂
If you do anything rather slightly complex,

638
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:08,405
你就不能做你想做的事情
you can't do the things you want to do

639
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:09,712
并且很快就失败了
and it quickly falls down.

640
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:10,920
在实际中它并不适用
It is unworkable in practice.

641
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,670
所以你需要的是更多的掌控
So what you need, of course, is more control,

642
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,180
而Service Worker可以帮你掌控
and Service Worker brings you that control.

643
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,620
让我讲讲它是如何工作的
So let me tell you how it works.

644
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,320
大意是说当你访问一个站点
The basic idea is when you visit a site,

645
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,941
你可以安装一个Service Worker
you can install a Service Worker,

646
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,440
Service Worker 是一个基本的
and that Service Worker is basically

647
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,670
脚本
a script off to the side.

648
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,700
当浏览器准备从域名上
And now, when the browser is going

649
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,260
获取资源的时候
to fetch a resource from your domain,

650
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,200
不是直接的去访问网络
instead of going to the network, it

651
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,740
而是去问Service Worker   hey  你想要做什么
asks the Service Worker, hey, what do you want to do?

652
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,454
Service Worker会说
And the Service Worker can say, just do

653
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:40,620
做你要做的吧  请去访问网络
what you would have done, go to the network, please,

654
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,260
或者是说请到缓存里面去取
or it can say, please hand back this thing from the cache,

655
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,900
甚至是忽略这个请求
or it can even say, create a resource on the fly

656
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,500
并返回
and pass that.

657
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,000
所以说  这是一个
ELISABETH MORANT: So basically, it's

658
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,001
用JavaScript写的代理客户端
a client side proxy written in JavaScript.

659
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,000
差不多
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

660
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,890
这个能让你更加任意地构建出复杂的
So this allows you to build arbitrarily

661
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,970
离线体验
complex offline experiences.

662
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,000
当我说任意地的时候
And when I say &quot;arbitrarily,&quot; what I mean is you

663
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,780
我是指你可以构建出及其复杂或者是十分简单的例子
can build something extremely complex or extremely simple.

664
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,920
I/O的web应用就是一个很好的
So the I/O web app is a great example

665
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,730
复杂的离线web应用
of a complex offline web app.

666
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,727
它能够准确的进行缓存  即使你是在
It does very careful caching so that even if you load it

667
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:13,060
完全离线的情况下  你也能获得出色的体验
when you're fully offline, you get something meaningful,

668
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,700
但是当你连接上了网络  它会为你展现一个用户界面
but then when you're connected, it will show you UI about, hey,

669
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,616
这有新的内容
there's fresh content.

670
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:18,530
点开看看吧
Tap here to see it.

671
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,090
当然  更像一个解决方案
Of course, a more likely scenario or easier scenario

672
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,580
一个简单的能缓存一切的解决方案
is just to aggressively cache everything

673
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,340
你可以使用它这样就可以进行离线工作了
you use so that your thing works offline.

674
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,520
这有一个叫做sw-precache的Gulp插件
There's a great Gulp plug-in called sw-precache

675
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,950
它能够很容易的帮你这个集成到你的工作流里面
that makes it incredibly easy to integrate into your workflows.

676
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,460
当然  这样的话
And of course, the simplest possible thing you can do

677
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,400
你就能摆脱那个可怕的离线小恐龙
is get rid of that darn offline dinosaur for your thing

678
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,720
并且和Service Worker说hello了
and basically say, hey Service Worker,

679
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,520
当用户离线来访问我的站点时
if the user tries to fetch my site and we're fully offline,

680
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,250
看到的不是离线小恐龙
instead of showing the offline dinosaur,

681
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,010
而是我事先准备好的界面
just show my own little splash screen

682
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,200
说  请连接网络后再试
that says, please connect to the internet and try again.

683
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,630
这个几行JavaScript 代码就搞定了
That takes only a few lines of JavaScript.

684
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,900
Service Worker 处理离线来说实在是酷极了
So Service Worker is cool for offline,

685
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,690
但是它还有一个绝招
but it has another trick up its sleeve.

686
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,780
一个Service Worker可以和多个标签页进行通讯
So a Service Worker, a single one, can talk to multiple tabs

687
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,540
它也可以不和任何标签页通讯
or it can talk to no tabs.

688
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,800
这也是第一个地方  开发者可以编写和运行脚本
So it's the first place that we as developers have a place

689
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,240
即使是没有任何一个站点标签页在运行
to write and run script even when no tabs for my site

690
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,970
are open.

691
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,178
这很糟
ELISABETH MORANT: That's bad.

692
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:17,127
用户不希望有任何一个脚本
People don't want any random site executing

693
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:18,210
在后台执行
scripts in the background.

694
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,160
的确  但是这也是为什么Service Worker
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly, and that's

695
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,190
是事件驱动的
why Service Workers are event driven.

696
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,841
那么当访问网络的事件开始时  都发生了什么了呢
So what happens is a networking event happens, the browser goes

697
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:25,340
浏览器会到Service Worke那 说
to the Service Worker and says, hey,

698
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,830
Hey 我监测到了一个网络事件
I've got this network event.

699
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,706
Service worker就开始处理并完成它
Service worker handles it and then it's done.

700
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,913
它仅仅就是呆在那里不做任何事
It's just sitting there not doing anything because it

701
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:31,525
因为它也不能做
can't.

702
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:33,650
其余的时间我们则把它冻结
And so at that point, we can freeze dry that thing,

703
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,880
并放进存储里
put it off in storage. 

704
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,370
直到浏览器发送新的事件
ELISABETH MORANT: Right, until the browser sends a new event

705
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,140
才把它唤醒
to wake it up.

706
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,600
对的
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

707
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,330
当一个新事件过来时
So when a new event comes in, we bring it

708
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,205
我们把它快速的放入内存  非常的快
back into memory really quickly, which takes,

709
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:44,580
我觉得大约只需50毫秒  将其投入工作
I think, around 50 milliseconds or so in practice in the wild,

710
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,070
这样它就能做自己的事
and then it can go on its way.

711
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,630
还有就是Service Worker
So the cool thing is that this isn't just related

712
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,180
不只是和网络事件相关
to network events.

713
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,620
你可以想象它与其它的事件配合
You can also imagine other types of events

714
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,110
将其唤醒并工作
that would potentially wake it up to do work.

715
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,340
我懂了
ELISABETH MORANT: I see.

716
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,975
所以浏览器可以基于用户的实际需求
So the browser can choose what type of event

717
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:01,450
去选择它想要发送的请求
it wants to send based on what it thinks the user actually

718
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:01,950
wants.

719
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,950
就是这样
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

720
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,340
这非常的强大
So this is really powerful.

721
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,960
它带给了web
It enables an entirely new class of functionality

722
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,590
一个之前不可能做到的新功能
that before wasn't even possible to bring to the web.

723
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,840
还有带来了另一个新特性
ELISABETH MORANT: So one of the new features only made

724
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,430
Service worker 可以推送通知
possible because of Service Worker is push notifications.

725
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,465
直到现在  只有本地应用才可以
Until now, only native apps were able to send

726
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:19,840
推送通知
push notifications, but there are

727
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,850
但是仍然会有很多情况你想推送通知
cases where you would want push without everything else that

728
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,285
comes with being an app.

729
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:25,910
这很重要吗
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So are these important?

730
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,140
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

731
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,900
这非常重要
This is extremely important.

732
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,240
通知领域是一个新的战场
Basically, notifications are game changing for engagement.

733
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,550
当人们和手机交互的时候
More and more, people are interacting with their phone,

734
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,090
打开新的应用并且开始体验
opening up new apps and experiences largely

735
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,970
是因为他们事先收到了通知
because they got a notification first,

736
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,780
而这种情况越来越不常见  那就是
and it's much less common that people will open up their phone

737
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,242
人们打开手机查看应用列表
and dumbly look at their app grid

738
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,380
来决定他们该用那一个应用
and decide what they want to use.

739
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,440
这有一个例子
Here's an example.

740
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,930
卫报有一个本地应用
So the Guardian has a native app and they

741
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,890
并且他们发现当重大事件发生后的几个小时后
found that in the hours after a breaking news event, up to 40%

742
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,930
从收到推送通知而过来的文章阅读量上升到40%
of their article views came from push notifications alone.

743
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,005
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wow.

744
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,330
非常巨大
ELISABETH MORANT: It's huge.

745
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,360
我来展示一下通知的重要性
And so to demonstrate how important this is,

746
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,560
我将进行一个demo
I'm going to jump into a demo.

747
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,674
9个月前的奥斯卡季  我在家里
So nine months ago, Oscars season, I was at home

748
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,090
但是我有一大堆的工作要做
but I had to do a lot of work so I

749
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,470
所以就不能去看奥斯卡颁奖礼的直播
wasn't able to watch the Academy Awards live.

750
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,170
这对我来说很不爽  
This was a huge bummer for me, so what I ended up doing was

751
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,100
所以我停下了手头的工作
I would jump between my computer and then I

752
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,720
一直在刷新卫报的直播博客看看谁获奖了
kept refreshing the Guardian live blog to see who had won.

753
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,350
我不断的刷屏
And what I would do is I'd refresh

754
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,990
我想看看Reese Witherspoo穿什么了
and I'd see what Reese Witherspoon is wearing,

755
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,640
并且不断的点击
and then I'd click on that and look

756
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,830
看看她过去的电影海报  然后心神不宁的
at some of her past filmography, and then just get distracted

757
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,180
回到电脑上继续工作
and jump back to my computer.

758
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,380
其实啥事都没做
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Basically, getting nothing done.

759
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,338
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

760
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,828
什么工作都没做
Basically, I was not getting anything done, or at least

761
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:37,360
一份任务也没完成
I wasn't getting a lot of work done.

762
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,090
但是如果卫报可以推送消息的话会怎样
But what if the Guardian had push notifications?

763
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,600
要是我不用这样折腾来折腾去
What if I didn't have to jump in and engage

764
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,070
卫报就可以告诉我那些
and instead the Guardian told me when there was information

765
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,080
我想知道的信息
that I actually wanted to know.

766
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,520
我开始打开直播博客向下滚动
So suppose I open up the live blog and I scroll down

767
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,130
 我看到了开启通知的按钮
and I see the ability to follow the story.

768
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,152
卫报说明了为什么我该选择打开通知
So the Guardian explains why I'd want

769
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,690
因为我想及时的获取
to opt in to notifications, I want

770
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,930
这个内容的信息
to engage with this particular piece of content,

771
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,064
所以我选择了开启浏览器通知
so I hit Enable Browser Notifications.

772
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:06,980
与此同时Chrome询问我
And at this point, Chrome sends me the prompt,

773
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,020
要不要打开通知  我选择了接受
and yes, I want notifications, so I say Allow.

774
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,710
Great.

775
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,050
所以现在的话我就可以接收到
So, now confident that I'm going to get notifications

776
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,549
我感兴趣的内容的通知了
about the content I'm interested in,

777
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:22,110
我关闭了Chrome继续去工作
I can just close Chrome and get back to work.

778
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:29,420
我在工作并且收到了一个通知
So I'm working and I see a notification.

779
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,760
我不知道你们能不能看到它
I don't know if you can see it.

780
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,740
我从未测试过这个
I haven't tested this out.

781
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,670
我在手表上收到了这个通知
So I see a notification on my watch

782
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,780
它说最佳音效剪辑奖揭晓了
that says that sound editing won some award.

783
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,170
这是一个我不感冒的奖项所以我清除通知了
Now, this is one of those lame awards so I just swipe it away.

784
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,160
我不感兴趣
I don't care.

785
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,150
所以你在手表上收到了通知
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So you got that on your watch?

786
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,108
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

787
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,990
我在手表上收到了通知
I got it on my watch because Chrome sends notifications

788
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,719
是因为Chrome会像其他Android一样发送通知
just like any other Android app would, and in that same way,

789
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,510
我在手机上收到通知
I get notifications on my phone just like I

790
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,840
就像其他的消息应用一样
do from my messaging apps.

791
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,090
我对刚才的内容不感兴趣继续回去工作
So I wasn't interested in that content, so I go back to work,

792
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,375
喝咖啡  吃甜甜圈  写重要的摘要
drinking coffee, eating donuts, writing very important briefs.

793
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:06,391


794
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:06,890
Oh.

795
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,470
我收到了另外一个通知
I see another notification.

796
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,190
它说鸟人获得了最佳影片奖
And this one, of course, &quot;Birdman&quot; won best picture.

797
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,689
我们都觉得布达佩斯大饭店
I mean, clearly we all know that the movie that should have

798
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:16,980
应该拿到这个奖
won the award was &quot;The Grand--&quot;

799
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,520
等等
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Wait, wait.

800
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,040
布达佩斯大饭店
ELISABETH MORANT: &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel,&quot;

801
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,690
我想在座的各位都会同意我的看法
which I'm sure everyone else in the room agrees with me about.

802
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,430
为了表达我的看法
So in order to express my opinion,

803
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,690
我会查看通知打开直播的网页
maybe I'll dive into the live blog, open up the website,

804
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,830
也许会写一些有品位的评论
maybe leave a few very tastefully written comments

805
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,490
关于为什么这部电影该获奖
about why this movie should have won.

806
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,090
我不耽误大家时间了
Anyway, but I won't bore you with that now.

807
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,490
通知推送的重要之处
So the point is push notifications

808
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,283
在于让你获取到你想要的信息
let you know information when you want it.

809
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:49,231


810
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:49,730
Alex?

811
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,730
怎么了
ALEX KOMOROSKE: What?

812
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,267
非常抱歉
ELISABETH MORANT: I'm so sorry.

813
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,100
你要知道这对我来说有多么的重要
Can you just-- you know how to wrap this up.

814
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,250
Imagine Dragons的票已经开卖了
I just-- Imagine Dragons tickets just went on sale.

815
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,890
你在逗我吗
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Are you kidding me?

816
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,945
我们这可是在进行I/O talk
We're in an I/O talk.

817
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,020
我知道  但是我非常喜欢这支乐队
ELISABETH MORANT: I know, but I told you

818
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,730
他们的票马上就要卖光了
they're going to sell out and I really love this band,

819
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,850
我只需要两秒钟  两秒钟
and I just-- it'll take me, like, two seconds.

820
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,820
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

821
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,430
Great.

822
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,532
我想我们该回到刚才的那页slide
I guess why don't we go back to the slides?

823
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:09,740
我觉得 Elisabeth是说
So I think the point that Elisabeth was going to make

824
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,660
通知推送的重要性
is that push notifications are great.

825
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,190
在某种情况下  通知即是内容
In some cases, the notification is the content.

826
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,040
一看便知
You get all you need just by seeing it.

827
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,016
或许你也想打开里面进去看
In some cases, you want to dive in.

828
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,410
有些时候
And in other cases, it's information

829
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,100
某些通知对你来说十分重要
that is so important to you that you want it to interrupt you

830
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,070
你想在任何时候任何地点都能收到它  
at any time or place, including when you're presenting in front

831
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,470
即使是站在百人之前的I/O演讲上面
of hundreds of people at I/O.

832
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,970
我买到票啦
ELISABETH MORANT: I got the tickets.

833
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Great.

834
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,088
祝贺
So happy for you.

835
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,200
希望这挺值
Hope it was worth it.

836
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,658
无论如何
ELISABETH MORANT: Anyway, the point

837
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:36,150
通知推送的关键之处在于这是一个新的主动交互方式
is that push notifications are this new primary interaction

838
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,650
paradigm.

839
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,730
也是人们与应用融洽沟通的方式
It's how people engage with their apps.

840
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,940
把通知推送带到web上来
And bringing push notifications to the web

841
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,050
得以让你真正能够关注你想关注的东西
allows you get information about what you care about

842
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,850
before you've decided to necessarily commit

843
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,720
to everything else that comes with an app.

844
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,030
举个例子  我每个月都要访问Ticketmaster一次
So for example, I visit Ticketmaster once every couple

845
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,326
我非常希望能收到
of months, but I really wanted notifications

846
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,950
关于这部分内容的通知
about this particular piece of content.

847
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,160
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

848
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,826
那么我们什么时候
So the obvious question that we all have

849
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:58,900
可以用上这个
is when can we use this?

850
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,770
六个月之后
Six months from now?

851
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,610
一年之后
A year from now?

852
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,068
就是现在  对所有的Chrome用户开放
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, this is shipped to all Chrome users

853
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,249
任何人访问一个具有开启了启用通知的站点
today, so anyone who visits a site with this enabled

854
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,290
都能够接收到通知推送
will be able to get push notifications or the Add

855
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,748
或者是添加到主屏幕
to Homescreen prompt and developers

856
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:11,560
开发者也可以添加这个新功能到他们的站点
can start adding this to their site at any time.

857
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,700
And so the Guard--

858
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,204
[APPLAUSE]

859
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:17,120
我觉得这是一个很好的工具
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I think it's pretty cool, too.

860
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,661
非常酷
ELISABETH MORANT: Pretty cool, right?

861
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:20,037
卫报和票务大师的工程师团队
So the Guardian and Ticketmaster,

862
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:22,202
制作出了你今天所看到的演示原型
both of these engineering teams built the prototypes

863
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:23,880
并且他们打算
that you saw today, and they're planning

864
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,360
在未来的几个月内在他们的站点
on bringing push notifications to their sites

865
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,960
推出通知推送的新功能
live in the coming months.

866
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,490
不仅仅是他们
And they're not the only ones.

867
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,950
我们有一些合作商
We have a number of early adopters

868
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,283
也将会在接下来的几周内推出这个功能
who are rolling out push notifications within the coming

869
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:34,987
weeks.

870
00:30:34,987 --> 00:30:37,070
真是非常酷炫的东西
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the cool thing about this, too,

871
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,710
这个只能在Chrome上面用吗
is this isn't just some Chrome only feature.

872
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,020
我们也和Mozilla进行了合作
We designed this very collaboratively with Mozilla,

873
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,210
在相关的规范上也同样适用
working in standards bodies.

874
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,700
事实上这是一张来自Firefox的截图
And in fact, this is a screenshot from Firefox

875
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,766
几天之前截的  Firfox的Night版本弹出相关信息
that I took a couple days ago, Nightly Build with a flag

876
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,640
咨询用户获取通知推送的权限
flipped that shows them asking for permission

877
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,810
for push notifications.

878
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,810
这也是一个非常好的例子
So that will be coming there at some point, too.

879
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,770
激动人心
It's pretty exciting.

880
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,760
Service Worker 为我们带来了新的功能
So Service Workers allows us to bring all kinds of capabilities

881
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,620
得以让那些以前不能实现的事情实现
to the web that before really didn't make sense

882
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,772
or couldn't make sense.

883
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:06,230
我们也和其他的浏览器厂商合作
And because we're designing them with other browser vendors

884
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,830
制定出相关规范 
and standards bodies, it's something

885
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,090
得以让你在不同的平台上使用
that you can come to rely on.

886
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,380
它仿佛开创了移动互联网的一个新纪元
It's kind of like the dawn of a new era for the mobile web.

887
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,570
ELISABETH MORANT: OK.

888
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,861
我们今天只关注当下  不讨论未来
We promised we were only going to talk about today, not

889
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:14,430
the future.

890
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:14,640
ALEX KOMOROSKE: OK.

891
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,056
另外的一个好消息是
Well, the cool thing about this is

892
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:18,580
你今天就可以使用它  并且这些新特性
you can start today because these features are

893
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,341
都是渐进增强的
great at progressive enhancement.

894
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,840
所以当你通过浏览器
So if you go to one of these sites in a browser that doesn't

895
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,485
去一个不支持通知推送的站点
support push notifications, well, you see the same site

896
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:27,510
你会发现它和之前没什么两样
that you would have seen before, but if you

897
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,950
但是当你去一个支持通知推送的站点
go to that site in a browser that does support push

898
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,810
也许他们会在那里添加一个按钮
notifications, maybe they add another button that says,

899
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,870
hey 当内容发生变化的时候通知我
hey, I want to be notified when this thing changes.

900
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,890
假如我是用户并选择的话  选择后者
And then if I as a user opt in, I

901
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,080
因为我有更高价值的事情
can have a really high value thing

902
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,465
对我来说更加的重要
that's really important to me even before it's

903
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,120
在这个特性在被每一个浏览器支持之前
shipped in every browser out there,

904
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,581
所以我觉得这非常激动人心
so I think that's pretty exciting.

905
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:47,330
我们今天讨论了
ELISABETH MORANT: So we talked about a lot

906
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,890
大量高层面的话题
of topics at a high level today, but there

907
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,660
但是仍然有很多高质量的DevByte以及Box Talk
are a number of DevBytes and box talks

908
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,400
你可以参加  以便做更加深入的了解
that you can visit that will go into a lot of these topics

909
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,710
more in depth.

910
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,400
我们今天讨论了三件事
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So today, we talked about three things.

911
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,872
web的强大力量以及它的范围
ELISABETH MORANT: The superpower of the web, reach.

912
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:04,080
移动互联网上面做出的巨大性能进步
ALEX KOMOROSKE: How performance has made huge strides

913
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,730
on mobile web.

914
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,180
以及我们创造出强大的新方式
ELISABETH MORANT: And how we're baking powerful new ways

915
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,770
帮助用户和那些他们真正需要的内容建立起联系
for you to build relationships with your users, many available

916
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,929
它们有的现在可用或者即将到来
now and a lot more coming soon.

917
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:15,470
把这三方面孤立起来看
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the three of these

918
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,553
没有什么特别
alone aren't that special.

919
00:32:16,553 --> 00:32:18,661
但是把它们联合在一起来看
It's the confluence of these three things

920
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:19,660
就变得非常重要
that's really important.

921
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,080
你忘记了最重要的一点
ELISABETH MORANT: Well, you're forgetting the most important

922
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,480
one.

923
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,813
正是这些
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's a good point because these things

924
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:27,460
才让创造伟大的东西成为可能
by themselves, they just make it possible to do cool things,

925
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,240
但是当你把它
but what happens when you combine

926
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,960
和全球化阵营的能工巧将们联系在一起的时候
that with this global community of tinkerers and builders

927
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,920
这将创造出无比强大并且令人振奋的作品
and makers, well, that's when something really awe inspiring

928
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,820
happens.

929
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,800
我都有些迫不及待了想看看你构建的作品了
ELISABETH MORANT: We can't wait to see what you build.

930
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,130
谢谢
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thanks.

931
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,530
[APPLAUSE]

932
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:48,549


933
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,340
大家有什么问题
So I think if there are any live questions,

934
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,370
可以现场提问
we can take them here.

935
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,730


936
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,430
首先  非常精彩的演讲
AUDIENCE: First of all, fantastic talk.

937
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,640
谢谢
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thank you.

938
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,010
问题是关于Service Worker
AUDIENCE: The question is about the Service Workers

939
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,870
响应事件的
which respond to events.

940
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,030
它会包含类似于Ajax请求
Does it involve events like Ajax requests

941
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,870
或者是网络无法正常连接的事件吗
or it's only when you don't have a network which in reachless?

942
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,620
当你检测到一个事件时会发生什么
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So basically, what happens

943
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,730
is you get a fetch event.

944
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,940
在你的Service Worker里你会说
So in your Service Worker you say,

945
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,030
Chrome  请在从我域名上获取任何内容时通知我
Chrome, please notify me when any content from my domain

946
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,850
然后你就会捕捉到那个事件
is fetched, and then you'll catch that event,

947
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,890
你会知道请求的URL是什么
you'll pass in what the request URL was, and you

948
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,112
并且你可以为此做出回应
can respond to it that way.

949
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,570
这个在网络连接正常
That happens even when you're fully

950
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,560
以及糟糕的网络连接上都会发生
connected because of course, you might be on flaky connectivity,

951
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,360
所以你要确保已经为你的站点
and so you want to make sure you can design your experience

952
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,980
设计了不同网络环境下
with total control over what happens

953
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,830
良好的体验方式
over networking to your site.

954
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,630
你的意思是像HTML的内容层
AUDIENCE: So you meant content, like HTML,

955
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,065
或者说它包含了Ajax请求的事件
or it includes Ajax requests?

956
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:40,190
事实上每一个到你站点的请求
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Basically almost every request that

957
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,030
goes to your site.

958
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,560
只有个别是特别
There's a few exceptions for specific things.

959
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,310
如果你使用类似于
AUDIENCE: So if you're using things

960
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,650
OAuth  自动验证的东西
like OAuth, which automatically authenticates,

961
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,520
获取数据的模式是怎样设计的
what's the design pattern to get data?

962
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,660
比如说如果你使用Google plus认证
Like, for example, if you used Google+ authentication,

963
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,302
就会直接在你的页面上登录
which directly logs onto your page--

964
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,260
这觉得是一个好问题
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I think that's a great question

965
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,134
你可以去那边继续的深入讨论
to go into in more depth in the office hours,

966
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,485
但是你已经掌控了一切
but you have total control over this.

967
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:04,360
这非常之强大
It's pretty powerful.

968
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,240
我想这对你来说是一个简单的问题
AUDIENCE: I've got an easy one for you, I hope.

969
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,389
关于主屏幕
The home screen.

970
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,739
你刚才提到你们能发现有多少用户使用添加到主屏幕的
You mentioned that you find it interesting how many people

971
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,550
use the home screen.

972
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,719
我对此十分震惊
I'm shocked at that.

973
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,219
我在哪里才能看到这个数据  有多少人使用了
Where can I see the numbers for it, how many people actually

974
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,670
添加到主屏幕
add stuff to the home screen?

975
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,310
我不清楚如果我们今天
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So I don't know if we

976
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,170
分享了这些数据会怎样
have those numbers to share today,

977
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,880
我想说的是
but it's one of those things that even

978
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,320
尽管是一个被埋没的特性
despite being a buried feature, I think

979
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,460
我想用户也能在其中发现大量价值
people find a lot of value in.

980
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,834
这也是为什么
That's one of the reasons that we

981
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,389
我们决定通过主动的方式
decided to bring this feature to other websites

982
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,136
把这个特性带到网站上来的原因
in a more proactive way when we feel

983
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,719
在我们确信用户会对此感兴趣的情况下
pretty confident that the user will be interested in that one.

984
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,960
我在哪里可以找到这些数据
AUDIENCE: Where can I find those numbers?

985
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,500
你们是从哪里获得的
Where do you find them from?

986
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:37,790
非常抱歉
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I'm sorry.

987
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,100
这些都是我们的内部数据
Those are numbers that we have internally.

988
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,308
保密数据
AUDIENCE: Oh, secret numbers.

989
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:43,110
是的  保密数据
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah, secret numbers.

990
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:46,790
使用Service Worker的优点是什么
AUDIENCE: What's the advantage of using a Service

991
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,130
比如说在两三年前的愤怒的小鸟上
Worker over something like what we had at Angry

992
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,760
使用 Service Worker 
Birds two or three years ago.

993
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,010
在两三年前的Google I/O
At Google I/O two or three years ago,

994
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,086
愤怒的小鸟还在使用着离线存储
they were using offline storage for Angry Birds.

995
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:58,960
那么使用Service Worker的优点是什么
What's the advantage of using Service Worker?

996
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,335
Service Worker可以
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So Service Worker

997
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:03,094
帮你细腻的掌控网络上发生的
allows you to have very fine grained control

998
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:05,260
所有情况
over all aspects of what's happening on the network,

999
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,020
然后你可以使用一些技术类似于 Index DB
so then you can use technologies like Index DB and Explicit

1000
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,690
以及 Explicit Cache API 
Cache API to do stuff, whereas before, you

1001
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,450
然而以前你则被局限在高级别上的声明方法上面
were limited to a very high level declarative approach.

1002
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,842
如果它对你适用  这非常好
If it worked for you, it was great, but more likely

1003
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:18,800
但是它也可能对你无用
it didn't work for you.

1004
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,520
在一些你想处理的特殊场合
It couldn't do exactly what you wanted

1005
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,330
它是无法做到的
to handle in this particular case

1006
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,790
所以说它可能对你无用
and so it was basically useless.

1007
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,680
Service Work是这样的一种思考方式
So Service Worker, the way to think of it

1008
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,260
你熟悉可扩展Web宣言吗
is-- are you familiar with the Extensible Web Manifesto?

1009
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,740
这是一个概念
So that's a notion that we should

1010
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,640
定义了一些低级的基本类型
be defining the lower level primitives that

1011
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,657
解释web平台是如何工作的
explain how the web platform works,

1012
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:36,240
摆脱高级层面上的东西
so getting rid of the high level magic

1013
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,470
给开发者接入低级基本类型的权限
and giving developers access to the low level primitives that

1014
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,030
让其得以工作
make that magic work.

1015
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,830
所以说更像是在App Cache中深挖
So Service Worker is like digging

1016
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,190
来弄明白里面都有些什么
down deep below App Cache to figure out what was there

1017
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,190
如何工作的并把它传递给开发者
and how it worked and expose that to developers.

1018
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,380
你明白吗
Does that make sense?

1019
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,068
也许没有  下一个
Probably not, but OK.

1020
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:51,726
Sorry.

1021
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:53,350
我有一个关于在离线状态下
AUDIENCE: I have a question on the user

1022
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,610
用户体验的问题
experience on the offline sites that you showed me.

1023
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,930
假如用户通过隧道浏览
So let's say the user is traveling inside a tunnel

1024
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,840
然后网络中断了
and then there is a network break.

1025
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,480
那么我们怎么判断此时这个用户是处于在线
So how do we notify the user at this moment, you are online,

1026
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,180
还是离线呢
and then you go offline.

1027
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,594
你刚才讲的是离线的情况
This experience that you're having is the offline period,

1028
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:12,260
然后此时网络又回归正常
and then the network can come back again

1029
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,560
你再次上线
and you can come online again.

1030
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,160
非常好
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's great.

1031
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,743
Service Worker可以
So the cool thing about Service Worker

1032
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:18,150
 让你全力掌控你的应用
is you have full control to do what's right for your app.

1033
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,640
举个例子
So in particular-- for example, I

1034
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,326
我觉得I/O应用实现了这个  当你网络情况很差的时候
think the I/O app does this-- if you're on flaky connectivity,

1035
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:25,700
它会提示  我将会展示默认的从缓存中获取到的内容
it can say, I'm just going to default and show everything

1036
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,670
然后去获取新的资源
directly from the cache and then fetch fresh resources.

1037
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,330
当用户在浏览的时候
And so what might happen is the user is already looking at it.

1038
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,630
新的内容已经获取到了
Fresh content has come back.

1039
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,575
你肯定不想
You don't want to go [MAKES NOISE]

1040
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:35,910
就把内容粘贴出来因为这会让用户
and put the content there because they'll

1041
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,400
跟不上思路
lose their train of thought.

1042
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,510
但是在这些使用Service Worker的demo中
But with Service Worker in some of these demos, what people do

1043
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,650
将会有一个很小的UI提示说
is they'll have a small bit of UI that says,

1044
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,100
请上拉刷新获取新的内容
&quot;Fresh content is available if you scroll up.&quot;

1045
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,440
这样的话  就会连贯起来
And that way, you don't lose your way in the app.

1046
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,040
关键在于
But the point is, of course, that you

1047
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,240
你可以掌控你应用的一切
have control to do what's right for your app, which

1048
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,300
这非常的棒
is pretty exciting.

1049
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,400
很棒
AUDIENCE: That's cool.

1050
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,350
谢谢
Thank you.

1051
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:56,980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

1052
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,360
我的问题是关于你演示的那个demo
My question is in the demo that you showed.

1053
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,349
我收到了来自卫报应用的推送通知
I get a notification from the Guardian app

1054
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,640
然后你打开卫报的应用图标
and you go to the home screen of the Guardian app icon,

1055
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,422
点击打开  并且开始阅读
and then you click, and then you open, and then you read.

1056
00:37:06,422 --> 00:37:08,880
能不能直接的点开通知
Is it possible that from the notification directly, I can--

1057
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,838
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

1058
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,710
这仅仅是一个demo中的bug
That was just a bug in the demo.

1059
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,420
那么当你点击通知时会发生什么呢
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So what happens is

1060
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,960
当你点开通知
when you tap on the notification,

1061
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,860
Service Worker会收到事件请求
your Service Worker receives an event

1062
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,290
说通知已经被点击
that says the notification was clicked.

1063
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,660
此时你可以不做任何处理
At that point, you can say, OK, do nothing,

1064
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,020
你也可以保持原来的标签页
or you can say, focus a tab that existed before

1065
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,250
或者是打开新标签页
or open a new tab.

1066
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,550
ELISABETH MORANT: Yeah.

1067
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,530
我希望点击通知
So I was supposed to click on the notification

1068
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,984
就直接跳转到我想要了解的通知中的内容上面
and jump directly to the content that it was notifying me about.

1069
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:31,525
AUDIENCE: OK.

1070
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:33,305
谢谢
Thank you.

1071
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:34,200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

1072
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,829
非常相似的问题
Very similar question, but rather

1073
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:37,620
但不是关于点击通知
than tapping on a notification, what if you

1074
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,455
如果你收到了email链接会怎样
get an email with a link?

1075
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:41,580
会打开什么与之相关联的应用吗
Is there any kind of association that would open up

1076
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,827
that installed web app?

1077
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:47,410
我不清楚它具体是怎样工作的
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I don't know the particulars of exactly how it

1078
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,993
但是如果你安装了一个
works, but if you are an installed web

1079
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:51,980
带有清单文件的web应用  会出现一些与目标系统
app with a manifest, there will be some cases that

1080
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,550
比如Android   不能完美契合的情况
don't necessarily fit exactly perfectly into the intent

1081
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,290
我们也一直在这方面努力
system of Android, but we're working on those.

1082
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,770
我没有这方面的具体信息
I don't have all the information for you in depth on that,

1083
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,270
所以
though.

1084
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,995
你可以去那边深入的进行讨论
You should take it to office hours.

1085
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:01,620
好的
AUDIENCE: Sure.

1086
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,970


1087
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,651 
最后一个问题
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One question.

1088
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,400
通知设置的同步
AUDIENCE: Are the notification preferences

1089
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,754
是通过用户账户还是通过设备来同步的
synced across a user's account or is it per device?

1090
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:13,170
通过设备
ELISABETH MORANT: It's per device.

1091
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,795
这样做的原因
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And the reason for that

1092
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:18,120
是不同的设备有着特别的使用背景
is the context that you opt in is very device specific.

1093
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,520
所以我个人可能对八卦绯闻感兴趣
So I might be interested in seeing celebrity gossip

1094
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,610
因为有这个需求
on my personal-- because I have a thing for that,

1095
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,380
很显然  要在我本人的机器上
apparently-- on my personal machine,

1096
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,900
但是我并不介意
but I don't care about it enough to be

1097
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,750
在我离开时通知我
notified when I'm on the go.

1098
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,960
用户的使用背景
And so exactly where the right user context

1099
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,380
取决于你所使用的设备  所以它不会被同步
depends on the device you're in, and so it's not synced.

1100
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,213
通知设置是针对
AUDIENCE: And is the notification preference

1101
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:40,819
域名或者是特定的网站吗
per domain or per specific website?

1102
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,610
主要是域名
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's per domain, basically.

1103
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,340
问题在于  对于站点的作者来说一定要确保
And so the idea is you want to make sure as a site author

1104
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,122
非常小心的使用它
that you use it very respectfully.

1105
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:49,580
我们没有在这个通知中
So one thing we didn't show in this

1106
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,440
演示的东西是
is the notifications that show up

1107
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,750
这里有一个明显的站点设置按钮
have a very obvious Site Settings button

1108
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,530
如果用户点击他它  它就会直接的
and if a user taps on that, they're taken directly

1109
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,620
跳转到Chrome中那个域名的相关设置
into Chrome Settings for that domain, where

1110
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,910
可以通过一系列的操作
it's a couple more taps to revoke permissions

1111
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,800
撤销那个域名的相关权限
for that domain.

1112
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,580
作为站点的作者
And so as a site author, you want

1113
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,419
你必须要确保你向用户们表明了你的权限
to make sure that you explain to users what you're going to do

1114
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,460
尊重他们的顾虑
and that you respect their attention because it's

1115
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,260
因为对用户来说
very, very easy for them-- of course,

1116
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,940
他们非常容易就能撤销你的权限
they're in control-- to revoke permission very easily

1117
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,437
如果你违背它的话
if you abuse it.

1118
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,270
谢谢
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1119
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,260
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Sure.

1120
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,010
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1121
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,610
感谢大家
Appreciate it.

1122
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,660
[APPLAUSE]

1123
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:21,665
