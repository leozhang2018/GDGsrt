00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,260
Hi
ANDY GRANOWITZ: Hi.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,560
我是Andy granowitz  Google Analytics的开发技术推广工程师
Andy Granowitz here, developer advocate for Google Analytics.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,090
今天我要谈谈  如何去配置Google Analytics
Today I'm going to talk a little about setting up Google

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,040
在初次使用的时候
Analytics for the first time.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,840
Google Analytics因其易于在网站及移动App上
Google Analytics is known for being straightforward to deploy

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,062
部署而闻名
on your website or app.

7
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:17,520
事实的确如此
And although this is true, there are a few important things

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,360
然而在首次安装Google Analytics之前
to consider when you install Google

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,250
仍有一些重要的事情需要考虑
Analytics for the first time to make

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,580
以确保最大限度的发挥
sure you get the most out of the powerful features

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,900
Google Analytics的无穷潜力
that Google Analytics offers.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,587
最基本的数据收集方式
The most basic measurement track--

13
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:29,670
就是在移动应用和网站上
measurement is going to be pageview or screen view

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,370
分别运用Pageview和Screen view tracking
tracking on web and app, respectively.

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,539
对于大多数网站来说  设置pageview tracking非常简单
For most websites, setting up pageview tracking is straightforward.

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,330
只需向每一个网页里
Add the Google Analytics JavaScript snippet

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,140
插入一段JavaScript跟踪代码
on every page, and Google Analytics

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,300
Google Analytics就会自动统计页面的浏览量
will count each time the page is loaded.

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,690
这点在移动应用上实现起来会有点儿复杂
This is a little bit more involved on mobile apps.

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,400
但是可以通过使用iOS或者是Android的相关SDK
But once you set up screen view tracking

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,790
设置screen view tracking  这也能达到效果
using iOS or Android SDK, the results are very similar.

22
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,940
Google Analytics会默认进行大量的数据收集
Google Analytics will measure a lot by default, even

23
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,070
即使进行了基本的设置
with this basic setup.

24
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,000
例如  通过设置基本的page或者是screen view tracking
For example, with just page or screen view tracking,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,650
Google Analytics会自动地
Google Analytics will automatically

26
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,160
帮你分析会话时长  特定网页或者是页面的浏览时间
allow you to analyze the session duration, time

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,470
地理位置信息  比如国家地区以及城市
on specific pages or screens; geo-information, like city

28
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,240
以及相关技术数据  比如浏览器和移动设备信息
and state; technology data, like mobile device or browser;

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,410
每页上的用户流量
user flow between pages or screens;

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,960
以及用户的来源  比如说搜索引擎
and where users are coming from, like search engines,

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,620
社交网络 抑或是其他站点  等等
social networks, referrals from other sites, and so on.

32
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,000
Google Analytics会自动捕捉大量的信息
So there's a lot that's captured automatically.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
但是通过个性化的定制
But with some customization, Google Analytics

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
Google Analytics会有的放矢选择捕捉一些
can capture user interactions that

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,030
在站点或者是移动应用上产生的
are unique to your site or app and that are really

36
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,810
对你来说至关重要的用户互动信息
important to your business.

37
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,540
Google Analytics为不同的应用场合
Google Analytics offers many different customizations

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,880
提供了多种个性化方案
for many different use cases ranging

39
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,935
从电子商务到资源的载入时间的统计
from measuring e-commerce to how long resources take to load,

40
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,310
但是在初次开始配置Google Analytics时
but there are three that I'd like

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,120
我想着重强调三个个性化方案
to highlight when first getting set up--

42
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,520
事件  自定义维度 以及  广告标记
events, custom dimensions, and campaign tagging.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,170
事件是用来查看用户如何与您的网站或应用进行互动的
Events are used to measure interactions within a given

44
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,530
换句话说  一切不是载入网页
page, in other words, anything that is not

45
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,930
或者是载入应用新界面的动作
a page load or a new screen.

46
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,250
但是你不必统计所有的事件
But keep in mind that you don't need to measure everything.

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,110
你只需思考对你来说重要的用户互动事件
Think about what are the most important user interactions

48
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,850
然后有计划的统计它们
and plan to measure those.

49
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,660
这能有效防止在进行分析时的数据过载
This will prevent data overload when doing analysis.

50
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,540
自定义维度
Custom dimensions.

51
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,660
正如我们之前所讲  Google Analytics默认会捕捉大量的信息
As we discussed, Google Analytics captures a lot of data by default.

52
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,620
但是一般来讲  重要信息对你
But often, the most important information

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,824
往往会非常特别的作用
is very specific to your business,

54
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,490
没有了你的帮助  Google Analytics在统计关键信息时
making it difficult for Google Analytics

55
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,500
就变的异常困难
to measure without a little help from you.

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,040
通过自定义维度  你可以向Google Analytics导入自定义的数据
With custom dimensions, you can send custom data

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,160
然后它会自动地
to Google Analytics, which will automatically

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,970
和Google Analytics已收集的现有
get correlated with all of the other data

59
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,480
其他所有数据相关联起来
that Google Analytics collects.

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,890
举个例子  当用户订阅了你的实时通讯
For example, when signing up for your newsletter,

61
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,850
用户可以有选择的去订阅服务商
if the user has the option to identify their industry,

62
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,060
通过自定义维度你可以把这个信息传递给用户
you may want to pass this information as a custom dimension.

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,240
另一个例子  则是发生在用户注册你的服务时
Another example might be when a user signs up for your service,

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,207
他(她)们的可以30天免费试用
whether they signed up for the 30-day trial,

65
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:52,165
还是标准会员  亦或是高级会员
a standard membership, or a premium membership.

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,020
最后一个我想谈谈的个性化方案
The final customization that I'd like to talk about

67
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,780
叫做广告标记
is campaign tagging.

68
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,989
Google Analytics会密切的监视HTTP referer
Google Analytics looks at the HTTP refer

69
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,300
并且不遗余力的计算出你的流量都是从哪里来的
and does its best to figure out where your traffic is coming from.

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,710
但是当你开始使用自定义广告
But when you run custom campaigns, like through an ad

71
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,380
无论是通过广告网络  还是电子邮件交易
network, or if you're doing some email marketing,

72
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,310
亦或是其它之类的媒介
or, really, any other medium, you

73
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,590
你都可以使用Google Analystics的网址构建工具
can use the Google Analytics URL Builder

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,420
向推广给客户的网址中添加自定义广告系列参数
to add query parameters to the URL you're promoting to your users.

75
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,250
当用户点击链接  网址中所添加的参数
When users click on that link, the parameters you've added

76
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,710
会被Google Analytics自动识别
are automatically recognized by Google Analytics.

77
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,010
所以在报告中  你可以准确地知道
So in your reports, you'll be able to find out exactly

78
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,050
哪个广告为你的网站或者是应用带来了用户
which campaigns brought users to your site or app

79
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,390
以及最终他(她)们都干了什么
and what they ultimately did.

80
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,250
这儿有一个特例
One special case.

81
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,230
如果你使用Adwords服务的话  我强烈建议
If you use AdWords, I strongly recommend

82
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,180
将Google Analytics和AdWords账户关联起来
that you link Google Analytics and AdWords accounts.

83
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,430
这样做  AdWords会自动地
By doing so, your AdWords campaigns will automatically

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,470
将广告参数标记出来
get tagged with campaign parameters,

85
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,850
大量的数据会被导入到Google Analytics账户
and a lot of other valuable data will

86
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,010
促进数据间的互惠共享
be imported into your Google Analytics account.

87
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,380
除了能和AdWords紧密关联
In addition to this deep integration with AdWords,

88
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,930
Google Analytics也可以和Google的其他产品
Google Analytics can also integrate

89
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,770
密切结合  比如AdSence  Webmaster Tools
with other Google products, such as AdSense, Webmaster Tools,

90
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,830
AdMod  以及其他
AdMob, and more.

91
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,580
你要确保找到对你来说最容易的方式
Be sure to find out if there's an easy way

92
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,246
来连接Google Analytics
to connect Google Analytics and whatever

93
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:08,080
无论你用的什么技术  也不论他们是不是Google家的
technologies you are using, whether they are Google or not.

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,740
想要获取更多的相关个性化信息
