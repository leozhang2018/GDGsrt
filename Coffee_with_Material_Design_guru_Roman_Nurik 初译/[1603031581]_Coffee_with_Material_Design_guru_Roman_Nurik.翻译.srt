1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,630
欢迎来到 Googleplex
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome to the Googleplex.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,170
这是一个每天都能和一些优秀员工
This is an incredible place with lots of great stuff being

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,060
交流的奇妙地方
worked on every single day.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,940
在我还没来这工作之前
Before I worked here, I always wondered

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,260
我总是在想，要是能来到 Googleplex 该多好
what it'd be like to come to the Googleplex,

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,750
和 Googler 们面面基，喝喝咖啡
meet up with a Googler, and have coffee with them.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,420
聊聊他们在都干什么，是如何做的，为什么要做这个
And just chat about what they do, how they do it, and why they do it.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,360
今天梦想成真了
And today we're going to do exactly that.

9
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,300
欢迎来和 Googler 喝咖啡
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome to Coffee with a Googler.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,383
我是 Laurence Moroney，我在纽约城
I'm Laurence Moroney and I'm here in New York City

11
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:27,940
和 Roman Nurik 聊聊天
to meet with Roman Nurik.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,890
Roman Nurik 是 Google Material Design 的大牛
And Roman Nurik is one of our material design gurus here at Google.

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,887
谈道 Material Design，告诉我们它是干什么的吧
So material design, tell me what's it all about.

14
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:35,970
好的，Laurence
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, Laurence.

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,412
什么是 Material Design
What is material design?

16
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:40,620
这有点难解释
It's kind of hard to explain.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,240
实际上原来有一个视频
There's actually a video with a bunch of the original designers

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,920
讲的是 Material Design 的设计师们
that created material design and they

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,480
他们也同样被问到这个问题，也不知道该如何回答它
get asked the same question and they don't know how to answer it.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,530
这说起来还蛮复杂
It is a complex kind of thing.

21
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,890
涉及到很多事情
There's a lot of things going on.

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,700
首先从最基本的层面讲，它是一门设计语言
I guess is the most basic level, it's a design language.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,040
也是一个设计系统
It's a design system.

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,120
涵盖视觉交互以及动作行为设计
It covers visual interaction and motion design.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,630
我觉得大多数设计系统以及设计语言
I feel like most design systems, design languages,

26
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,500
都统归于视觉语言
are treated as just visual languages.

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,090
比如你该用哪种颜色等等
Like here are the colors you should use, and so on.

28
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,600
但 Material Design 可不止这些
But material is much more than that.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,690
它涵盖很多模型
It really kind of covers the model,

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,520
潜在的物理模型以及 UI 模型
the underlying physical model, of the UI.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,230
所以它实际上是试图创建一个
So it basically tries to establish

32
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,850
适合你应用生存的一个物理环境
this physical environment within which your apps should live.

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,330
在手机、平板、桌面设备，以及任何的屏幕上
On a phone, on a tablet, on a computer, basically any sort of screen.

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,318
它创建这个物理环境
And then it basically establishes this physical environment and a set

35
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:37,470
并且建立了相关的规定和原则
of basic rules and principles.

36
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,260
我习惯把这个总结为四个轴
And I like to think of it along these kind of four basic axes,

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,340
或者说是四个基本原则
or four basic principles.

38
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,350
这是个形象的比喻
And that's tangible surfaces.

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,980
对于 Material 来说
Work on the material metaphor.

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,130
这样我们就能具体的谈谈 Material 是什么了
We can talk about what material is at some point.

41
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,010
也是一次大胆的平面设计尝试
Also bold graphic design.

42
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,220
我们应该从印刷的世界里学学一些优秀设计灵感
This idea that we should take some of the best design ideas

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,030
看看它们是如何帮助我们
from the print world and see how they can help us make really

44
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,380
在电子设备上创造出优秀的应用的
great apps on digital devices.

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,870
第三个则是关乎有意义的动效
And the third is meaningful motion.

46
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,190
如何把这些东西，这些平面
Basically how all these things, how these surfaces,

47
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,830
以及平面上的组件，图形设计元素
and the ink on that surface, the graphic design stuff,

48
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,860
协调起来
how that all moves in a consistent way to help

49
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,187
促进交互沟通
communicate what's going on.

50
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,770
第四件事,也是最重要的一件事情之一
And the fourth thing, which is to me one of the most important

51
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,860
则是适应性设计
things, is adaptive design.

52
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,120
这也是为什么我们能让前面提到的那三项
Which is how can we take all these first three things

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,790
能够正常协同工作的奥妙
and make sure that they work consistently

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,495
跨越不同的设备、手机和平板
and coherently across different devices, phones and tablets,

55
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,590
以及其他
and everything else.

56
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,506
正好这有一个视频
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now you have a video, right,

57
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,180
上面有一些优秀的 Material Design 运用实例
of some really good examples of material design being used.

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
我们给大家放一遍？
So should we roll that?

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,850
好的
ROMAN NURIK: Let's roll it.

60
00:02:41,850 --> 00:03:29,774
[MUSIC PLAYING]

61
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,190
这真是足够优秀的实例啊
LAURENCE MORONEY: So some pretty excellent examples there,

62
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,300
但是问题是，有人能到达那个高度吗
but it's like, "How does somebody reach that level?"

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,530
拿我来说，我是一个开发者
And for someone like me, I'm a developer

64
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,600
我的设计技能几乎为零
and my design skills are nonexistent.

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,760
所以我想成为那个可以运用 Material Design
So if I want to become somebody who

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,370
来开发应用的人，我该如何开始？
can build apps with those kind of design, how do I get started?

67
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,710
我也要学这个吗？
How do I learn this stuff?

68
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,960
这是一个好问题
ROMAN NURIK: That's a great question.

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,876
首先，我来设想下
I think first of all, I just want to, I guess,

70
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:53,740
这些应用的背后它们都在做着出色的工作
recognize some of those apps they're doing amazing jobs.

71
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,230
它们可能有一个比较大的团队
And they have large teams, some of them

72
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,930
或者是小团队
actually have very small teams.

73
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,790
有些应用甚至是个人开发者开发的
Some of those apps are created by one person.

74
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,960
所以你是绝对可以达到那个高度
So you can absolutely reach that level of quality

75
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,540
来开发那些出色的应用的，不管你的团队有多小
from these amazing showcase apps regardless of your team size.

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,410
但是我想对开发者和设计师说的是
But I'd say for the developers and designers

77
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,076
这一切才刚刚起步
out there that are just getting started,

78
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:14,650
仍有大量的资源可以利用
there are a lot of great resources out there.

79
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,709
在 Udacity 上也有不少课程
There's a great Udacity course that me, Nick Butcher, also

80
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,650
由 Nick Butcher 和我以及 Udacity 的 James Williams 共同录制
from Google team here, and James Williams from Udacity put together.

81
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,914
你可以通过访问 udacity.com/google 来获取
And that's available at udacity.com/google.

82
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:31,190
同样在 design.google.com 上
And there's also a bunch of amazing resources

83
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,580
也有更多的资源在等着你
on design.google.com which will tell you

84
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,580
它会指导你如何在 Android 使用 Material Design
about how to come to Android if you're doing iOS stuff, for example.

85
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,010
如果是搞 iOS 方向的话,你可以了解一下 Material Design 是什么
Or how to get started understanding what material design is.

86
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,250
那里有 Material Design 的全部指导原则
Obviously the entire material design guidelines are there.

87
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,190
从观看 Udacity 的课程开始
So I'd say that's the first thing the Udacity

88
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,834
应该是新手起步的最佳选择
course is probably the best first step in getting started.

89
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,750
那里有大量资源
But there's a whole lot of resources out there

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,580
我们也那里做了其他资源的链接
and we link to others from the Udacity course.

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,020
谈到 Udacity 课程
LAURENCE MORONEY: And Udacity courses,

92
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,394
如果你还没听说过的话
if you're not familiar with them,

93
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:03,450
它们采用问答式的教学方法
they're very Socratic in how they teach.

94
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,520
通过短视频来让你挑战某件事情
It's short videos and then challenging you to do something.

95
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,020
然后再来一个短视频教你起步做这件事
And then a short video and then getting you to do something.

96
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,230
总之这是一个让人快速学习的好方法
And it's a good way to someone can incrementally

97
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,342
而不是把你扔进巨大的设计文档堆里
learn rather than be thrown into a huge design doc

98
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:15,372
或者类似的事
or something like that.

99
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:18,600
毫无疑问,这样进展显著
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah it's definitely-- there's a very clear progression.

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
我们特别地安排了那门课程
We specifically designed that course

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,250
你可以从了解一些基础知识开始
so that you can kind of start with some of the basics.

102
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,340
关于屏幕上的一些基础知识
The most elementary basic things about a screen,

103
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,720
比如说什么是像素,什么是独立像素密度
like what is a pixel, what is a density independent pixel.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,780
之后水到渠成的你就能知道
And then you ramp all the way up to how

105
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,114
我该怎样把这个运用到手机,平板,以及其它设备上
do I make everything work on phones, tablets, and so on.

106
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,613
我就假设这些设计课程都是经过精心设计的了
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I have to assume that design course is

107
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,380
well designed.

108
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,410
我们在 Slide 和绘画板里
ROMAN NURIK: We have some very nice color

109
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,056
也做了一些非常棒的颜色选择
choices in our slides or our tablet drawings, so hopefully.

110
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:46,180
让我们再次回到 Material Design 话题
LAURENCE MORONEY: So back to material design again.

111
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,500
为什么是 Material
Why material?

112
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,370
谈到 Material 就回到刚才说的第一个原则了
ROMAN NURIK: So material goes back to that first principle.

113
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,210
也就是具有实体属性的平面
So this idea of tangible surfaces.

114
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,150
这意味着屏幕上的一切
This idea that everything on your screen and your device

115
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,190
都在其中的一个平面上
exists on a surface.

116
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,470
我们喜欢把它想象成一张纸
We like to think of them as pieces of paper.

117
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,310
你也可以看作是一片材料
So basically you can think of basically a sheet of material

118
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,180
或者说是表现在一张纸上
or the word material representing one of those pieces of paper.

119
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,680
我们不把叫它叫做纸是有原因的
And the reason we don't just call it

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,930
因为它不仅仅是一张纸
paper is because it actually is a lot more than just paper.

121
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,340
现实世界的纸张,一旦你把它撕碎
In the real world paper, once you rip it up

122
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,370
你就不能将其复原
you can't really just put it back together.

123
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,550
而且纸也不能从一个圆形变成一个正方形或者是矩形
And paper can't go from being a circle to a square to a rectangle.

124
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,900
所以我们将其看作是材料中的数字碎片
And so we like to think of our digital pieces of material,

125
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,470
或者是一片材料,一种智能的纸张
or sheets of material, as kind of a smarter paper.

126
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,390
仍是一种存在约束的纸张,你可以尽情使用
Still a constrained paper, you can just do anything.

127
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,400
但其也有缺憾
It can't just do all sorts of crazy things,

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,440
它只是在特定环境下存在的一种物理介质
but it is a physical thing that exists inside

129
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,550
在一种人造的特定环境
of this kind of environment, this kind of like faux environment.

130
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,200
依旧有很多的想法可以在上面付诸实践
But it is something that has a lot of thought put into it.

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,080
所以 Material 这个词对我来说是一片纸张
And so the word material to me really

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,540
里面可以容纳一些东西
means, the sheets of paper that everything in this world exists on.

133
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,690
对我来说真正要考虑的事情是
But for me is the main thing to think about,

134
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,620
动作在 Material Design 非常的重要
the reason that motion is so important in material design

135
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,130
一切的动效都应该是有意义的
is that motion should always have meaning.

136
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,910
尽量不要做这些动作，比如翻转一个按钮
Try not to just do it like a flip of a button,

137
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,017
或者是来一个双旋转
or like a double rotation, or something just

138
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:19,100
以及其他引起注意的动作
to kind of draw attention.

139
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,305
每一次的动作都会引起人们的注意
Every time something moves it attracts our attention

140
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:23,930
所以它应该变得有意义
and so it needs to be really thoughtful

141
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,300
需要小心翼翼的去设计
and really carefully planned out.

142
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,310
在 Material Design 中，我们可以利用足够的动作
And so in material, we use motion just enough motion

143
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,800
来传达物体的一些状态
to convey the change in some object's state

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,670
或者引起一些注意
or try to get a little bit of attention.

145
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,090
但是又不宜太多
But just enough motion not too little, not too much.

146
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,700
我知道 Android Studio有一些模板
LAURENCE MORONEY: I understand Android Studio has

147
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,180
允许开发者们在他们的 App 里
some templates to allow developers

148
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,420
融入 Material Design 风格 
to at least get started with building material design into apps.

149
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,419
是的
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

150
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,790
这也是我一直以来的人生观
So one of my philosophies for a long time has been,

151
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,800
我们创造出了 Material Design，或者说创造了一个东西
we can write about a material design, we can write about a thing.

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,110
我们可以针对这件东西给出很多建议
We can make suggestions about that thing.

153
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,000
我们可以告诉人们这个东西是干什么的
We can try to teach people about the thing.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,720
但是最佳的方法是能让人们上手去做
But one of the best ways to get the thing into people's hands,

155
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,470
拿 Material Design 来说，我们就将其集成在了相关工具里
in this case material design, is to actually just build it

156
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,290
into the tools.

157
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,350
只要确保开发者们都能够上手
Just make sure that as a developer that's just getting

158
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,060
拿 Android 举例，无论我在 Android Studio 上
started, even just on Android, if I just

159
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,190
新建一个项目或者是一个 App
go to File, New Project or new app

160
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,300
我都能够用上最新、最棒的 Material Design 
I should be able to get the latest and greatest.

161
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,860
所以我们在 Android Studio 中
And so in Android Studio, now we're

162
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,020
能看到很多 Material Design 模板
actually seeing new templates for material design.

163
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,230
你也可以创建一个新项目
So you could do file new project and then your default activity

164
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,909
默认的活动模板就是基于 Material Design 的
templates are going to come with material design in them.

165
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,380
现在就开始把 Material 主题用起来吧
So it's going to use the material theme.

166
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,690
这会利用一些新的 Material design 支持库
It's going to use some of the latest support

167
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,260
比如说 Android Design 支持库
libraries for material design, so things like the Android

168
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,150
AppCompat 之类的
Design Support Library, things like AppCompat,

169
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,970
你会免费得到一些超棒的东西
So you're just gonna get a lot of great stuff for free right

170
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,612
马上用起来
off the bat.

171
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,410
比如说我，我是一个程序猿不是设计师
LAURENCE MORONEY: So for someone like me, I'm a coder not a designer.

172
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,500
但是我可以用 Android Studio
But I could use Android Studio, get the effectively

173
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,310
用这些模板或者是脚手架来把这个问题解决掉
the scaffolding done for me in these templates.

174
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,966
然后也可以去 Udacity 上上课
And then learn from something like the Udacity course.

175
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:01,840
正解
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

176
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,190
我强烈安利你去 Udacity 上听听相关的课
I definitely suggest, even before you do the Udacity

177
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,150
新建一个项目
course, file new project.

178
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,410
看看相关代码
Just look around the code.

179
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,870
看看你的收获
See what you get.

180
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,620
我觉得这是一个很好的开端
I think that's a great way to get started.

181
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,910
实践是检验真理的唯一标准
I always valued as a kid growing up

182
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,270
learning programming and stuff I always valued experimentation.

183
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,200
而这正是实践
So definitely experiment with that.

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,192
如果你遇到什么障碍或者是困难的话
But as soon as if you hit an obstacle or something,

185
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,941
你可以看看教程以及相关的参考资料
obviously take a look at the guide and the reference, and all that.

186
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,070
再次安利一下 Udacity 的课程
But the Udacity course is a great way to say,

187
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,740
你知道吗，跟上 Google 的思考步伐
"You know what, let me just kind of see what Google thinks

188
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,237
是了解这个系统的最佳方式
is the right way to kind of approach understanding this system."

189
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:39,320
酷
LAURENCE MORONEY: Awesome.

190
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,261
感谢 Roman
Well thanks, Roman.

191
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,760
这是我今年学到的最有趣的
This has been a whole lot of fun and I've learned more about

192
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,470
关于 Material Design 的知识
material design in the last five minutes than I'd had in a year

193
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,790
再次感谢 Romen
before so thank you so much .

194
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,904
我能讲上一整天
ROMAN NURIK: I can always talk about this stuff.

195
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,820
他们跟我说了
LAURENCE MORONEY: They told me that about you.

196
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,990
这是我最爱谈论的话题
This is my favorite thing to talk about.

197
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,830
太酷了 Laurence
ROMAN NURIK: It's been awesome, Laurence.

198
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,240
感谢
Thanks.

199
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,130
我要去  Udacity 上瞧瞧相关课程
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm going to check out that Udacity course

200
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,730
也推荐大家去看一看
and I recommend that you do so too.

201
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,438
如果你是 Android 开发者想了解一下这些模板的话
And if you're an Android developer take a look at those templates.

202
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,896
如果你仍对其抱有疑问
If you have any questions for me about this, or if you have

203
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,840
或者是关于 Material design 的
any questions for Roman about material design,

204
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,970
